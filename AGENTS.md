# AGENTS.md: AI Persistent Memory

> AI memory. Loads EVERY session. Heavy detail → skill `references/`. Project values → `.agents/project.yaml`. Scripts → READ `package.json`. User-facing setup → `README.md` / `docs/`.

---

## 1. CRITICAL RULES: ALWAYS APPLY

1. **CREDENTIALS**: ALWAYS read from `.env`. NEVER hardcode/guess. Example keys: `LOCAL_USER_EMAIL`, `STAGING_USER_PASSWORD` (project-scope examples: the adopting repo renames or deletes them; the framework never requires them, `config.testUser` fails by name at the point of use). Scope of every variable → `cli/lib/variables-manifest.ts`; doctrine → `.context/ADR/ADR-0005-validation-scope.md`.
2. **PLAN BEFORE CODING**: Produce test plan (`spec.md` / impl plan) BEFORE writing test code. Flow: Plan → Code → Review.
3. **NO AI ATTRIBUTION**: NEVER include "Generated with AI", harness branding, or AI `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commits. Commits look human-authored. **Forensic trailers are the one MANDATORY exception and are NOT attribution**: every commit ends with `Worktree: <name|primary>` then `Session: <label>` — harness-agnostic provenance that answers "which checkout and which session produced this line", not "who wrote it" (canon + label rule: `/git-flow-master`). `Claude-Session:` and every other harness-branded trailer stay FORBIDDEN.
4. **SHIFT-LEFT**: Evaluate ACs for clarity, testability, completeness. Raise questions ONLY when genuine gaps exist, never force questions to fill checklist.
5. **PUSH TO PROTECTED = RESOLVE `git_strategy.policy.direct_push_to_protected`** (`.agents/project.yaml`; protected list = `git_strategy.protected`): `forbidden` → NEVER direct-push, route through a PR. `confirm` → ask explicit user confirmation before EVERY push. `allowed` → standing authorization, push without asking. `git_strategy` block missing or null (fresh scaffold) → behave as `confirm` (safe default: ask). NEVER hardcode the answer here — the variable is the decision.
6. **GIT HISTORY (INVARIANTS, not strategy choices — no `git_strategy` value relaxes them)**: NEVER rewrite pushed history (rebase/amend on pushed commits). NEVER force-push a branch others may share — at minimum every branch in `git_strategy.protected`, plus integration/ephemeral trunks in `git_strategy.branches`. NEVER delete remote branches without confirmation. ALWAYS add forward (new commits, not rewrite). ALWAYS preserve merge history.
7. **QUALITY VERIFICATION**: After code changes, verify in order: tests → types → lint. No skip steps.
8. **FILE OPERATIONS**: ALWAYS read file before edit. Preserve formatting + indent. NEVER overwrite without reading.
9. **SKILLS-FIRST**: All workflows live in `.agents/skills/`. NEVER paste instructions inline. Invoke matching skill, let it self-load detail. Use `[TAG_TOOL]` pseudocode + `{{VARIABLES}}` for dynamic content.
10. **MCP CREDENTIAL FAILURE = STOP IMMEDIATELY**: MCP fail auth or env var missing. **ALL THREE HOSTS FAIL SILENTLY EXCEPT CODEX** (measured on all three; ADR-0006): `.mcp.json` `${VAR}` unset → Claude Code passes the LITERAL `${VAR}` through and the server dies later on its first authenticated call, NOT a parse error (`claude mcp list` warns; startup does not). `opencode.jsonc` reads `{file:.auth/opencode/VAR}`: an existing empty placeholder (`bun install` creates them) → empty string, a missing file → OpenCode config error. `dbhub.toml` `${VAR}` unset → literal string, then a connection failure that reads as a database problem. `.codex/config.toml` is the ONLY loud one: a missing `bearer_token_env_var` is a hard error naming the server. **So a 401/403 or a mystery tool failure is the signal on every host but Codex** — never wait for a parse error that will not come. NO workaround. STOP, tell user exact env var, point to `.env` / `.env.example`, ask fix `.env` + **RESTART AGENT SESSION** (env cached at MCP-spawn time, no refresh mid-session). **MCP UNAVAILABLE = SAME STOP, AT THE POINT OF USE**: a skill step or user prompt that needs a capability no available tool provides (resolve by tool-name SUFFIX, never by server prefix: a claude.ai connector or a user-level server satisfies it too) STOPS before the step and names the capability + how to enable it; never a silent fallback to another tool, and never an alarm at session start for a server someone disabled: canon `agentic-qa-core/references/mcp-capabilities.md`.
11. **SCRIPTS = READ `package.json` DIRECTLY**. NEVER quote test/build commands from this file or any doc: drift kills. Open `package.json` first, then answer.
12. **KATA MANIFEST = SOURCE OF TRUTH**. `kata-manifest.json` (root) is authoritative registry of every existing Component + ATC. Before proposing new `Page`, `Api`, `Steps` module, or `@atc('PROJ-XXX')` ID: MUST load `kata-manifest.json` and check it. Anti-duplication gate. Stale manifest blocks commits via `.husky/pre-commit`. Regenerate: `bun run kata:manifest`. Validate: `bun run kata:manifest:check`.
13. **DEFAULT COMMUNICATION MODE: CAVEMAN**: If the `caveman@caveman` plugin is installed user-level (under `~/.claude/plugins/`), respond caveman level `full` by default (drop articles, fillers, pleasantries; fragments OK; technical terms exact; code/commits/PRs/security warnings always write normal English: caveman built-in boundary). Revert verbose ONLY when user explicitly say "normal mode", "habla normal", "stop caveman", "speak normally", "be verbose", "más detallado" or clear semantic equivalent. If the caveman plugin is not installed, rule = no-op.
14. **LANGUAGE DETECTION + MIRRORING**: At start of every conversation, READ FULL USER MESSAGE (not just opening words) to detect user's working language. Mirror that language in ALL conversational replies (questions, summaries, explanations, status updates). Repo artifacts ALWAYS English regardless of conversation language: code, code comments, commits, PR titles + bodies, branch names, file names, test names, configuration values, + any external action artifact (Jira issues/comments, GitHub issues/PRs/comments, Slack messages, emails, deploy notes, MCP tool inputs). Override: if user explicitly request another language for specific artifact ("crea el ticket en español", "write this PR description in Spanish"), honor that request only for that artifact + continue defaulting to English for next ones unless re-requested.
15. **NO GLOBAL DISCARDS (MULTI-SESSION SAFETY)**: PROHIBITED to run repo-wide destructive git commands: `git restore .`, `git checkout -- .`, `git reset --hard`, untargeted `git stash`, `git clean -f`. Multiple agent sessions may share this working tree without worktrees: a global discard silently destroys another session's uncommitted work, unrecoverably. Discard ONLY explicit paths YOU modified in THIS session (`git restore <path>...` / `git stash push <path>...`). Unsure who modified a file → do NOT restore it: ask the user.

16. **A SUCCESS CODE DESCRIBES THE CALL, NEVER THE OUTCOME — VERIFY AT THE DESTINATION**: `ok: true`, exit 0, `accepted`, `delivered` and a returned id all say the REQUEST was well formed. None of them says the thing happened. Measured on four surfaces in one day: a message delivered to the WRONG session by prefix match and returned success; a terminal created for a command that died in the shell; a send receipt carrying `"delivered_at": null, "read": 0` in the same payload that proved acceptance; a dispatch still reading `dispatched` against a terminal that had been replaced. **A green receipt is the most dangerous kind of green, because the successful receipt SUPPRESSES the verification that would have caught the failure.** So: a write is verified by READING IT BACK from the destination, a message by the recipient answering it, a transition by re-reading the issue's status, a file write by re-parsing the file, a dispatch by the worker's own first report. This is not orchestration-specific — it binds subagent reports, `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` writes, MCP calls, the updater and every CLI in §6.5. Where the cost of verifying is genuinely high, SAY the claim is unverified rather than letting the receipt stand in for it.

17. **COMMITTED PROSE NAMES THE SOURCE OF TRUTH, NEVER ITS CURRENT VALUE**: text that is committed (this file, `.agents/**`, `docs/**`, `README.md`, `INSTALLER.md`, `.env.example`, the decks) NEVER states a fact that changes with the normal life of the repo or the tracker. Forbidden: a COUNT that moves (tests, ATCs, skills, aliases, MCP servers, Jira fields / components / work types / statuses, files, rows, gates `N/N`, tokens); an ENUMERATION of a mutable set owned elsewhere (the skill list, the alias list, the server list, the custom-field list, the test-file list); a `file:line` citation (a path, a symbol or a heading is fine); a CURRENT-STATE claim ("today", "currently", "newest", "as of <date>", a measured size or timing, a tool version, a PR or issue number as live state); and EDIT-HISTORY narration inside doctrine ("since <version>", "correcting an earlier claim"). Every one goes stale within weeks, and then every session either trusts a wrong value or burns a turn reporting the drift. Write the NAME of the owner instead and let the reader resolve it: a file (`.mcp.json`), a command (`bun run skills:registry`), a generated artifact (`REGISTRY.md`), a constant (`CONFIG_BLOCK_READERS`). STABLE names that change only by decision are fine: stage names, KATA layers, rule numbers, file and command names, "three hosts". EXEMPT: gitignored files and `.session/**`, generated artifacts, ADRs / changelogs / dated reports (a number "at the time" is right forever), test fixtures, code constants, example output inside fenced blocks. A fact that must be stated with its date goes to an ADR and the doctrine links to it; the measurements behind this repo's own doctrine are in `.context/ADR/ADR-0006-forensic-measurements-ledger.md`. `scripts/lint-skills.ts` and `scripts/lint-docs.ts` flag the two regex-visible families (`FILE-LINE`, `CURRENT-STATE`); a line that must carry one is marked `volatile-ok: <reason>`. Canon + examples: `agentic-qa-core/references/volatile-facts.md`.

## 2. BEHAVIORAL LAYER: HOW AI REASONS

> Bias toward caution over speed. **Personality contract**: runtime contract for speech style + register. Human mirror → `docs/core/personalidad.html` (keep in sync when editing here).

**LAYER SPLIT (binding).** Three sources govern chat output, each on ONE dimension, never overlapping:

| Layer | Dimension | Source |
|---|---|---|
| caveman | word count | `caveman@caveman` plugin, level `full` by default |
| this §2 | WHAT is said, granularity, register | Butler + PM Voice + Visual Mapping, below |
| OUTPUT STYLE | how it LOOKS on screen + textual texture | active user-level agent instructions → `## OUTPUT STYLE` |

This §2 WINS on content and structure of information. OUTPUT STYLE never contradicts it: it only adds markdown-render discipline (headings, bold anchors, backticks, tables, block spacing) and human texture (no em dash, varied sentence length, no closing recap). Both compose with caveman, which only removes words.

**These instruction files are NOT a style model.** `AGENTS.md` and every `SKILL.md` are dense reference prose written for machine parsing. Do NOT imitate their typography, density, or arrow notation in chat replies.

**THINK BEFORE CODING.** State assumptions explicit. Multiple interpretations → present them, NEVER pick silently. Simpler approach exists → say so. Unclear → STOP, name confusion, ASK.

**SIMPLICITY FIRST.** Minimum code that solves problem. No features beyond ask. No abstractions for single-use. No "flexibility" not requested. No error handling for impossible scenarios. 200 lines that could be 50 → rewrite. *Scope note*: do NOT collapse KATA layers (TestContext / Base / Domain / Fixture): framework architecture, not speculative abstraction.

**SURGICAL CHANGES.** Touch only what required. Match existing style even if you'd do it differently. Don't refactor unbroken code. Don't improve adjacent comments/formatting. Notice unrelated dead code → mention, don't delete. Remove imports/vars YOUR changes made unused. *Scope note*: regenerative modes in `project-context`, `sync-ai-context`, and `test-documentation repair-traceability` are EXEMPT: regen IS task.

**GOAL-DRIVEN EXECUTION.** Define success criteria. Loop until verified. Transform vague tasks into testable goals ("add validation" → "write tests for invalid input, then make them pass"). Multi-step → state plan with explicit `verify:` per step (observable: test passes, file exists, exit 0, type-check clean). Complements 7-component briefing (§3): doesn't replace it.

**EXPANDABLE RESPONSES (BUTLER PATTERN).** Default to terse headline resolving user's literal question. Surface ALL other topics as atomic bullet menu: one specific topic per bullet, NEVER broad buckets. User pulls; don't push every detail at once.

- **Atomicity**: 12 specific bullets beats 3 broad buckets. Bundling hides the one item that matters.
- **No cap**: bullet count = actual information richness (2 topics → 2 bullets, 15 → 15).
- **Bullet style**: 1-line hook (`topic-name: short fragment`), not paragraph. NEVER an em dash as the separator (see active user-level agent instructions → OUTPUT STYLE).
- **Headline first**: stands alone even if user ignores menu.
- **Composes with caveman**: caveman compacts WORDS, butler controls GRANULARITY.

Example: headline "Sprint tested, 8 ATCs added, 2 bugs filed" + atomic bullets per ATC/bug/Jira link, not 3 buckets "Tests / Bugs / Reports".

**ASKING THE HUMAN TO DECIDE (binding).** Match the instrument to the SHAPE of the ask. One question with a handful of options, or two or three simple ones, go to the harness's own prompt: fastest path, answer in-turn. **More than three decision points, OR one decision whose tradeoff cannot be stated honestly in two sentences, goes to the `mkd` decision deck** (user-level skill, installed by `cli/install.ts`), and so does a long report the user should react to point by point, or row-by-row verdicts over a table. Below that threshold a deck is ceremony, and ceremony is how a good instrument gets abandoned. Every option in a deck carries a written justification with its VALUE and its COST, at most one is recommended, and the recommended one says WHY it wins. `mkd` absent → say ONE line offering to install it, fall back to the harness prompt, continue; never block on the offer. A decision taken through the prompt is a real decision. Canon, including how to read the returned contract and the rule that a note saying "I did not understand this question" means DO NOT EXECUTE that item: `agentic-qa-core/references/decision-elicitation-doctrine.md`.

**PM VOICE (DEFAULT REGISTER).** Default communication register is **Project Manager voice**, not senior-QA-to-senior-dev. Headline reports user, business, or quality value, not technical action. Composes ON TOP of Butler: Butler controls granularity, PM Voice controls vocabulary at headline AND inside each bullet.

- **Headline = value, not action**: lead with what changed for user, business, or quality posture, not which selector / fixture / spec file you touched.
- **Audience model**: reader is PM / PO / tester who understands product + flow, NOT Playwright APIs, KATA layer names, or TypeScript generics. Senior QA engineer REPORTING to PM.
- **No headline punch**: NEVER prefix the headline with an attention-priming phrase. Open on the value itself. A varying hook phrase is manufactured theatre and reads as machine-written.
- **Bullet menu orientation (conditional)**: 3+ expandable bullets → place short question between headline and menu. AI's choice, mirrors language. Skip for 1-2 bullet recap menus.
- **Bullets are SINGLE menu**: no PM-voice/technical split. One menu; AI chooses each bullet's register per topic. File path and AC-impact can sit side by side.
- **Suspension triggers (auto, one-turn, reverts after)**: switch to technical register when ANY fires: message contains file paths / shell commands / errors / selector strings / library names; user requests technical detail; topic touches security / secrets / auth / migrations / rollback / prod deploy; active skill is `/shift-left-testing`, `/sprint-testing`, `/test-documentation`, `/test-automation`, `/regression-testing`, `/framework-development`, or output is commit / PR body / code block / spec file.
- **Always-technical scopes**: code blocks, commit messages, PR titles + bodies, branch names, file names, security warnings, irreversible-action confirmations.
- **Risk-Surface override**: change affects data integrity, performance, security, or rollback → headline includes ONE line of technical impact.
- **Mirrors language**: PM Voice adopts user's language. Repo artifacts stay English per Critical Rule #14.

Example: ❌ "Added `waitForResponse('**/api/auth/login')` before toast assertion." ✅ "Login flow passes reliably even on slow networks: missing wait-for-toast was root cause."

**VISUAL MAPPING BIAS.** When content is naturally mappable, prefer visual representation over paragraph of prose. AI decides per-response whether visual materially aids comprehension: visual should REPLACE prose, not decorate alongside it. Composes with other strategies: Caveman compresses words, Butler controls granularity, PM Voice controls register, Visual Mapping controls form.

- **Types**: Tables: comparisons, key/value mappings, metrics. ASCII flow: sequences, pipelines, KATA layer flow. Trees: hierarchies, PBI structure. Boxes: architecture, environment maps. State machines: Jira transitions, bug lifecycle.
- **Placement**: below headline (primary expansion) OR inside bullet (mini-table/diagram beats prose).
- **Skip**: single-concept answers, yes/no, linear narratives, decorative structure.
- **Rendering safety**: plain ASCII (`+--+`, `->`, `|`) over Unicode box-drawing when uncertain about target terminal.

**SIGNALS THESE WORK**: fewer diff changes, fewer rewrites, clarifying questions BEFORE implementation. PM Voice → fewer "what does that mean?" follow-ups. Visual Mapping → readers grasp impact at-a-glance, paste tables into Confluence / ATR.

---

## 3. ORCHESTRATION MODE: PERMANENTLY ACTIVE

> **Main conversation = command center. Subagents = executors.** Active EVERY session. Not optional.

**USE SUBAGENTS FOR**: reading/writing multiple files, MCP ops, research across repos, git ops, verification (tests/types/lint), multi-file edits, long-running tasks.

**NO SUBAGENTS FOR**: quick lookups, memory reads/writes, task tracking, asking user, planning.

**TWO EXECUTORS.** One-shot subagents are the DEFAULT executor and nothing below changes that. A second, OPTIONAL executor exists: the **supervised worker** — a persistent agent session coordinated through `/orca-orchestration` (conductor ↔ worker mailbox). It is gated on the orchestration binary AND a reachable runtime; when either is missing the repo is SILENT about it and the work runs on subagents plus the `launch.txt` lines a human pastes. Never name it to the user from a workflow skill when the gate fails.

| | One-shot subagent (default) | Supervised worker (optional) |
|---|---|---|
| Lifetime | inside the turn | until it is explicitly closed |
| Context | lost when it reports | persists; you keep talking to it |
| Communication | none until it finishes | ask / reply / send at any moment, both ways |
| Git | the orchestrator's index | own worktree, or the shared checkout under declared file ownership |
| Best for | reading, mapping, verifying; one-shot tasks | writing + integrating alone, a whole story, work the owner wants to step into |

The conductor keeps using SUBAGENTS for its own reads and verifications: that is what keeps the coordinating context clean. A supervised worker is warranted when the unit of work is a whole scope (one story, one module) that writes and integrates by itself. Doctrine: `agentic-qa-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md`; transport: `/orca-orchestration`.

**7-COMPONENT BRIEFING (MANDATORY every dispatch)**: canonical template + filled examples: `agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md`.

1. **Goal**: one sentence
2. **Context docs**: files to read first
3. **Project Standards (auto-resolved)**: compact rules pulled from `.agents/skills/REGISTRY.md` (built by `bun run skills:registry`, validated by `bun run skills:registry:check`). Subagents trust these as authoritative for listed conventions and DO NOT re-read full SKILL.md unless explicitly told to. Protocol: `agentic-qa-core/references/skill-resolver.md`.
4. **Skills to load**: explicit (e.g. `/playwright-cli`)
5. **Exact instructions**: step-by-step, not vague goals
6. **Report format**: what to return (files changed, tests passed, blockers)
7. **Rules**: relevant Critical Rules to follow

**EXECUTION PATTERNS**:

| Pattern | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Parallel | Independent tasks | Read 3 context files at once |
| Sequential | Dependent tasks | Plan → Code → Test |
| Background | Long-running | Test suite + plan next ticket |
| Single | Simple task | One file edit + verification |

**ERROR PROTOCOL**: Subagent error → STOP, report full context, NO fix without approval, offer retry/skip/abort.

**WORKFLOW SKILL COMPLIANCE**: every skill marked `metadata.stage_owner: true` in its frontmatter (the stage-owning workflow skills) MUST have `## Subagent Dispatch Strategy` using 7-component briefing, AND close their final stage per `agentic-qa-core/references/session-footer-contract.md`. Every other skill (reference / utility / generator) is EXEMPT. `bun run skills:check` (`STAGE-OWNER-DISPATCH`) enforces the section on every flagged skill; `.agents/skills/REGISTRY.md` lists which skills carry the flag.

**DEEP DETAIL** (subagent-cacheable) → `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/` (briefing-template, dispatch-patterns, orchestration-doctrine).

---

## 4. CONTEXT LOADING MAP: TASK → WHAT TO LOAD

> BEFORE responding to any task: identify task type → load matching skill → read listed context. NEVER guess scripts/commands: READ `package.json` DIRECTLY.

| Task | Trigger phrase | Load skill | Read context | Primary tool |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| First-time orientation **OR user is lost / wants to understand a skill** | "onboard me", "first time using this", "I don't know how to use this", "how does `<skill>` work", "explain/teach me how X works", "no sé cómo usar", "no entiendo cómo funciona", "cómo funciona este skill" | `/agentic-qa-onboard` | (skill self-loads) | - *onboard enters teaching mode: SUSPEND caveman, explain in plain human language, and OFFER to open the per-skill `how-it-works.es.html` deck in the browser (ask first)* |
| Onboard target project | "onboard this repo", "set up project" | `/project-discovery` | target repo code, `.context/` if exists | Read + Grep |

| Write automated test | "automate", "E2E test", "API test" | `/test-automation` | `kata-manifest.json`, `tests/components/`, `.context/PBI/.../implementation-plan.md`, skill `references/` | Code edit |
| Derive test cases / coverage from ACs (ANY of the 4 testing skills) | "design test cases", "what to test", "cover this AC", "is this enough coverage" | (the active testing skill) | **`agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md` (MANDATORY)** | - |
| Report a bug / defect / improvement | "report bug", "file defect", "raise improvement", "found an error in the app" | (the active testing skill) | **`agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md` (MANDATORY)** | `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` |
| Annotate a bug screenshot (visual/positional defect) | "annotate bug screenshot", "mark up evidence", "anota este bug", "marca la captura" | `/bug-screenshot-annotation` | `agentic-qa-core/references/evidence-conventions.md` | `/playwright-cli` + local HTTP |
| Ask the user to decide (batch of decisions, or one dense one) | "decide", "which option", "necesito que decidas", "opciones", a report the user must react to point by point | - | **`agentic-qa-core/references/decision-elicitation-doctrine.md` (MANDATORY)** | `mkd` decision deck; harness prompt below the threshold or when `mkd` is absent |
| Discovery / inventory | "what components exist", "list ATCs", "is TC-X automated", "coverage map", "what's tested", "qué está cubierto" | - | `kata-manifest.json`; coverage map + gaps → `bun run tests:map` (reads `.context/PBI/`, offline) | Read / `bun run tests:map` |
| Regression / release | "run regression", "GO/NO-GO" | `/regression-testing` | `.context/master-test-plan.md`, CI logs | `gh` + Allure |
| Private report hosting (login-walled Allure) | "reportes privados", "make reports private", "protect test evidence", "login para los reportes" | `/regression-testing` | **`regression-testing/references/private-hosting-setup.md` (AI-executed protocol)**: AI clones + deploys the Test Report Portal (Supabase/R2/Vercel) and wires this repo's secrets; suite workflows are already dual-mode | CLIs (`supabase`, `wrangler`, `vercel`, `gh`) |
| Test-architecture decision (record/supersede) | "record an ADR", "document our fixture/runner/isolation decision", "architecture decision record" |: (see `.context/ADR/README.md`) | `.context/ADR/`, `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md` | Read + Write |
| Why the QA process is shaped this way (methodology, not a procedure) | "why do we create an ATS per story", "what is a stage / step / phase / altitude", "Early-Game / Mid-Game / Late-Game", "TMLC / TALC", "light mode", "what does IQL mean here" | `iql-context` (auto, kind `context`) | `.agents/project.yaml` → `qa.methodology`; `iql-context/references/project-overrides.md` | - *knowledge only: never runs a stage* |
| Refresh project maps / test strategy | "refresh context", "business data/feature/API map", "master test plan" | `/project-context` (selected mode) | target code, `.context/`, live read-only sources | Read + approved artifact write |
| Sync AI repository context | "sync AI context", "sync AI memory" | `/sync-ai-context` | `README.md`, this file, `.context/`, `package.json` | Edit |
| Orchestrate several sessions (fleet of workers) | "orchestrate", "fleet", "workers", "one session per story", "resume the run", "automation routine", "orquestar", "lanza workers", "una sesión por historia", "comunícate con el worker" | `/orca-orchestration` | `.agents/project.yaml` → `orchestration:` block (defaults); the skill self-loads its references | `[ORCHESTRATION_TOOL]` (gate: binary + reachable runtime; silent when absent) |

**Key paths**:

- `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`: **canonical test-design doctrine** (5 principles: AC-verify ≠ testing · AC = floor not ceiling · criterion-vs-test-case · 1:N explode-default/justify-collapse · risk-outside-criterion; + formal techniques EP/BVA/State-Transition/Decision-Tables/Pairwise/Error-Guessing with binding triggers; + Test-Design Checklist). Cited by all four testing skills; load BEFORE deriving any coverage from ACs.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md`: **canonical defect-management doctrine** (Bug/Defect/Improvement classification by the FEATURE's lifecycle stage · QA Assignee self-set + never-overwrite · mandatory Components · three-axis model parenting quality issues to the QA process epic, NOT a product/dev epic · mandatory field matrix + Severity→Priority auto-derive). Cited by all four testing skills; load BEFORE filing any quality report.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/decision-elicitation-doctrine.md`: **canonical decision-elicitation doctrine** (the ladder from harness prompt to `mkd` deck to plan mode · the threshold: >3 decisions or one dense one · what makes a deck worth the round trip · the non-silent gate and its fallback · delivery, including the worktree-bound browser tab and the one-copy rule · reading the returned contract, where a "did not understand" note means DO NOT EXECUTE). Load BEFORE asking a user to decide anything in batch.
- `agentic-qa-core/references/artifact-lifecycle.md`: **canonical artifact lifecycle** — which status every artifact is created in, which skill/stage moves it where via which transition slug, terminal status (§1) · the three edges the catalog does NOT have (§1.1) · assignee-at-create on every QA artifact, because Xray refuses membership edits on a Test Plan the caller does not own (§2) · the **unmapped-status fallback protocol** (§4: list the LIVE transitions, ONE `AskUserQuestion`, fire the live id, recommend `bun run jira:sync-workflows` — never a silent skip) · the **light stage verifier** template every stage closes with (§5). Load BEFORE any transition.
- `.context/`: project-wide context (discovery foundation by `/project-discovery`; maps and test strategy by `/project-context`)
- `docs/`: the HUMAN documentation site (HTML, Spanish), served by `bun run docs` (`bun run onboarding` opens its "Empezar aquí" page). `docs/core/` + `docs/assets/` + the portal files are shipped and synced by `bun run up`; every other folder under `docs/` is project-owned and never written by the updater. The AI does not load it: canon lives in `.agents/skills/` references.
- `.context/ADR/`: Test-architecture decision records (append-only). Hard-to-reverse test-arch decision (runner, fixtures, isolation, auth-in-tests, selector contract, flake policy) → record `ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md`; supersede, never delete. When-to-write + template → `.context/ADR/README.md`; AI detection/authoring → `agentic-qa-core/references/adr-doctrine.md`. Seeded by `/project-discovery`, `/framework-development`, `/sprint-testing`+`/test-automation` (Stage 1). NOT for flaky-fixes, local spec tweaks, or naming.
- `.agents/project.yaml`: `{{VAR}}` source-of-truth (load ONCE per session, cache)
- `.agents/jira-fields.json` · `jira-workflows.json` · `jira-required.yaml`: Jira catalogs
- `api/schemas/`: OpenAPI-derived TypeScript types (refresh: `bun run api:sync`)

- `bun run jira:baseline`: warns when `.agents/jira-required.yaml` declares fewer work types than upstream's baseline (`scripts/lib/jira-required-baseline.ts`). `jira:sync-workflows` catalogs only what the manifest declares, so a stale manifest silently regenerates a truncated `jira-workflows.json` and every transition on the missing types falls into the unmapped-status fallback. **Warn-only, never blocking**: a legitimate omission is not an error. Also printed inline by `bun run jira:check` and by `bun run setup:doctor`.

## 4.5. HOST HARNESSES: ONE SOURCE, THREE CONSUMERS

> This repo runs on **Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex (CLI + Desktop)**. There is exactly ONE copy of every instruction and every skill. Where the harnesses genuinely differ (MCP file format, hook API) each keeps a THIN versioned adapter. Nothing is duplicated.

**INSTRUCTIONS.** `AGENTS.md` (this file) is the only instruction body. OpenCode and Codex load it natively. Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md`, which is **exactly** `@AGENTS.md` plus one newline — a documented import, not a symlink, so it survives a Windows checkout. NEVER write operational prose into `CLAUDE.md`: that is structural drift, and `sync-ai-context` stops rather than propagating it.

| Surface | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex CLI + Desktop |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instructions | `CLAUDE.md` → `@AGENTS.md` **[generated shim]** | `AGENTS.md` (native) | `AGENTS.md` (native) |
| Skills | `.claude/skills` **[generated alias]** | `.agents/skills/` (native) | `.agents/skills/` (native) |
| Commands | none: `/<skill> <mode>` (the skill slash, through `.claude/skills`) | none: name the skill and mode in prose | none: name the skill and mode in prose |
| Hook | `.claude/settings.json` → `UserPromptSubmit` | `.opencode/plugins/personality-reinject.js` | `.codex/hooks.json` → `UserPromptSubmit` |
| MCP | `.mcp.json` | `opencode.jsonc` | `.codex/config.toml` |

**GENERATED vs VERSIONED (hard rule).** Bold `[generated]` cells above are OUTPUT. NEVER hand-edit `CLAUDE.md` (shim), `.claude/skills` (alias, gitignored, never committed) or `.agents/project.schema.yaml` (generated from `.agents/project.yaml`). Edit the source (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/hooks/`), then regenerate:

| Generated artifact | Its source | Regenerate |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (one-line `@AGENTS.md` shim, never prose) | `AGENTS.md` | `bun run agents:compat` |
| `.claude/skills` (POSIX symlink / Windows junction) | `.agents/skills/` | `bun run agents:compat` |
| `.husky/framework-gates.sh` (the gates upstream owns; each hook sources it in one guarded block) | upstream, synced by `bun run up` | never hand-edit it downstream; your own gates and their ordering go in the hooks |
| `.agents/project.schema.yaml` (the TEMPLATE a project's own yaml is compared against; SYNCED downstream, generated only in the boilerplate) | `.agents/project.yaml` | `bun run agents:schema` |

**`.agents/project.yaml` IS COMPARED AGAINST A SCHEMA, NOT AGAINST THE MAINTAINER'S COPY.** The file is `bootstrapOnly` — the sync never overwrites it, because it holds project identity — while upstream keeps ADDING blocks to it, so a project scaffolded before a block existed never learns it should have one. That used to be patched by one hand-written back-fill hook per block in `cli/update-boilerplate.ts`; a block added after a project was scaffolded (`orchestration:` was one) never got a hook, which is the proof the mechanism does not scale. Now ONE schema-driven hook does it for every key. `bun run agents:schema` generates `.agents/project.schema.yaml` from this repo's yaml, blanking the placeholders, keeping the methodology defaults, and REPLACING the values and comments that are this repo's identity (its ruleset id, its dates, its standing push authorization); a leak gate refuses to emit the file when a real date, ruleset or Atlassian host survives. `bun run agents:schema:check` gates the pair in `repo:check` and pre-commit, so a key added to the yaml and forgotten in the schema fails the commit by name. **`agents:schema` runs only in the boilerplate**: downstream the schema is a plainly synced file, and regenerating it there would blank the project's own yaml over the template and then report zero gaps forever.

Three consumers, three severities: `bun run up` offers to INSERT what a project lacks (insert-only, never an edit to an existing line, one prompt per top-level block, `--auto` warns and mutates nothing), `bun run setup:doctor` and `bun run agents:schema --project` DIAGNOSE it, and `repo:check` never fails on it — being behind upstream is not a broken repo, and a red CI on every upstream key addition is how a team learns `--no-verify`. Keys are compared to full depth with `environments.*` wildcarded (a project running `uat` and no `qa` is not nagged), values are never compared, project-only keys are silent, and an unparseable yaml says so instead of degrading to a narrower key set. A project that deliberately deleted a block silences it with `updater.schema_exempt: [<block>]` in its own yaml. Every write is a parser-located string splice re-parsed to verify: **NEVER `parseDocument(...).toString()` on a file under `.agents/`** — it rewraps folded scalars and rewrites `[main]` as `[ main ]`, and on `jira-required.yaml` it grows the file by kilobytes while changing nothing (ADR-0006). `.agents/jira-required.yaml` keeps its two hand-written back-fill hooks and the 2-level walk: same drift, richer shape, its own follow-up.

`bun run agents:compat:check` validates the whole contract: shim bytes, alias target, no harness command named like a skill, hook adapters, MCP parity, and the eslint block wiring. It runs in `repo:check`, in `pre-push`, and conditionally in `pre-commit`. The check and `setup:doctor` always print the alias status line (created / OK / deferred until the migration commit / missing) and group errors per surface (`COMPATIBILITY_GROUP_ORDER` in `cli/lib/agent-compatibility.ts`).

**A SKILL IS INVOKED BY NAME PLUS MODE; THERE ARE NO COMMAND FILES.** The boilerplate ships no `.claude/commands/` or `.opencode/commands/`: a skill plus a mode is the one invocation form on every harness (§5). A project MAY keep its own command files there; they are plain harness commands it edits by hand, and nothing generates or validates their body. The one refusal: a command whose name equals a repo skill hides that skill's instructions (Claude Code registers both under the same slash name and the command body wins), so `agents:compat:check` fails on it and `bun run agents:compat` (also run by `bun run up` and `bun run setup`) MOVES it to `.backups/shadowing-commands/<same path>`, recoverable, never deleted. The old alias overlay `.agents/compatibility/command-aliases.project.json` is inert: nothing reads it, and the updater names it once in an informational row.

**UPDATER END-OF-RUN.** `bun run up` closes with one "Estado por superficie" table (one row per surface; the list is `SURFACE_ORDER` in `cli/lib/updater-parity.ts`) and ONE parity prompt, saved to `.agents/prompts/parity-plan.md` (gitignored, single-use; `--dry-run` prints it and does not save it): numbered rows with evidence (headings, hunk counts, server ids, command paths), ONE row per path (a watched file that also fails a compat contract = one blocking row with both evidences). When handed that prompt: present the table, WAIT for a per-row decision `keep project | take upstream | merge`, apply only the chosen rows, then tests → types → lint. **`take upstream` is suggested only where the project lacks the content entirely**; a row naming project-only servers, keys, headings or edits says `merge`, and applying `take upstream` there anyway deletes project content (never do it unasked). A `merge` on a watched file always says what to port and what to keep (`port upstream additions only: <keys>; keep project-only: <keys>`; `keep project` when only the project has extra keys; `take upstream` only when upstream added keys and nothing else differs). Rows on `package.json` (a key kept at the project value, both values in the saved file) and on `Verificación` (a post-sync `types:check` / `lint:check` / `kata:manifest:check` / `skills:check` failure: exit code, first errors, which applied files they name; `--no-gates` skips them) are informational, never blocking. A synced file the project had edited and the run overwrote is a `merge` row naming its `.backups/` copy. `--strict` = exit 1 on a blocking parity finding (default warn, exit 0; drift on protected files never blocks, with ONE exception below: a kept file whose upstream hunk is a prerequisite for another file of the same release). An aborted run (dirty tree, corrupt lock, failed clone, declined migration/self-update) prints `Abortado.` and exits 1; a no-op run leaves the tree byte-identical (lock not rewritten). A re-run over the previous sync's uncommitted output is NOT an abort: `.template/last-apply.json` (gitignored) records what the run wrote with hashes and the guard recognises it; an unrelated or hand-edited synced path still aborts, naming `Commit sugerido` and the prompt path. With a pending self-update, `--dry-run` runs the fetched updater from the upstream clone (nothing written) so the preview is the new code's; without a TTY on stdin and no `--auto`/`--interactive`, the run assumes `--auto`. Protected watchlist (never overwritten, drift surfaces in the prompt): `AGENTS.md`, `.mcp.json`, `opencode.jsonc`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.husky/pre-commit`, `.husky/pre-push` (project gates), `allurerc.mjs`, `playwright.config.ts`, the KATA bases under `tests/components/`, the CI workflows; `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/` and the husky hooks ship ONCE when missing (bootstrap-only). A project protects any other synced file it merged by hand through `updater.protected_paths` in `.agents/project.yaml` (same semantics; invalid paths are reported and ignored); the row for an overwritten project edit ends with that fix and the saved prompt repeats it as YAML. `.agents/project.yaml` and `.agents/jira-required.yaml` are compared by structure only: an `informational` row for keys upstream added, no row for value differences (project identity). On the run that migrates a Claude-era repo the `.claude/skills` alias is NOT created (staged `.claude/skills/*` deletions behind a symlink break lint-staged), and every re-run before that commit keeps deferring it: commit the migration, then `bun run agents:compat` creates it. `cli/**` must type-check under a host whose `ProcessEnv` requires `NODE_ENV`: never cast a plain object straight to `NodeJS.ProcessEnv` in synced tests (`cli/updater-host-types.test.ts` guards it). `UPEX_TEMPLATE_REPO` (`OWNER/REPO` or a local clone path) points the updater at another source. The dirty-tree guard blocks ONLY on uncommitted work inside what the sync writes (synced component files, ignore files, `package.json`); dirt elsewhere (`tests/`, KATA code, protected files) is listed as `fuera de lo que este updater escribe; no bloquean`. A git-tracked `.context/PBI/` cache is ONE Componentes row pointing at the recipe in `.agents/prompts/pbi-cache-migration.md` (gitignored, single-use), never a terminal dump. A path just declared in `updater.protected_paths` gets its marker seeded with no row (the row fires on the next upstream change); a path upstream added after the lock cursor never gets an overwritten-edit row; the `cli` cursor advances after a self-update; MCP registry rows name the server and the fields that differ (`<server>: args differ`). The `cli` cursor also advances after a self-update from a parent that emits no env signal (the content fallback catches it), a heading changed only by punctuation is unchanged, `bun run skills:registry` reruns as the very last afterApply hook (an overwritten `.agents/skills/**` row ends with `after restoring, run bun run skills:registry`), a watched file with no marker yet whose upstream copy has not changed since the lock cursor seeds silently instead of firing a row, and the closing box prints `Gates: omitidas (sin cambios)` or `omitidas (--no-gates)` instead of dropping the line. Every row carries a `Now` column saying which copy is on disk (`kept` = the project's, `overwritten` = upstream's with the backup named, `-` = not a two-copy contest), so nobody has to reconstruct it from the hunks. A path declared in `PATH_PREREQUISITES` (`cli/lib/updater-parity.ts`) turns its kept row into a BLOCKING one that names what the hunk gates and the gate that proves it, because half a release is worse than either half: `skills:check` joined the post-sync gates for the same reason. An array-valued key reports `added: [...]` / `removed: [...]`, never "values differ" (an appended permission is not a changed value), and a truncated additions list always names the NEW top-level objects (a CI job, an MCP server) before the "+N more" scalars. On `--dry-run` the rows the apply step resolves by itself (the generated surfaces `bun run agents:compat` rebuilds) are marked `(resolved by apply)`: a dry-run legitimately lists more work than the run that applies, so plan from the real run. The `.context/PBI/` row says that an ignore rule does not untrack what is already in the index (the ladder is usually already correct) and counts any `test-specs/` path at a legacy depth, which the recipe names and makes you decide on BEFORE `git rm -r --cached`; the recipe's recovery tag is annotated and pushed (`git tag -a -m` + `git push origin`), and its untracking step is paired with an index audit (`git diff --cached --diff-filter=ACM --name-only | grep '^\.context/'` must print nothing) before the commit. `.claude/settings.json` gets an ADDITIVE merge of `permissions.allow` only — entries upstream declares and the project lacks are appended, and `deny`, `ask`, `hooks`, `env` and every other key stay project-owned and untouched; a project that deliberately removed an entry gets it back, deliberately, because a removal is re-expressible in `deny`, which nothing touches and which wins (one informational row names what was added). A top-level config block upstream added that the project does NOT have, and that a shipped skill reads (declared in `CONFIG_BLOCK_READERS`, `cli/lib/updater-parity.ts`), is a BLOCKING row instead of an informational `structural` one: without it the skill fails at runtime, mid-session, instead of at sync time — take upstream's block and adapt its VALUES, which are still yours. `AGENTS.md` additionally carries an unresolved-doctrine ledger: a section upstream has that this file does not is tracked by CONTENT, not by the one-nudge-per-upstream-change sha marker, so answering `keep project` does NOT retire it — it re-surfaces as one aggregated, never-blocking row until the section is actually written, and clears itself on the run that finds it present. `tsconfig.base.json`, `eslint.config.base.js` and `config/variables.core.ts` are SYNCED halves delivered by the `tooling` and `config-core` components; their project-owned counterparts stay watched. The release in which each of these behaviours landed is recorded in ADR-0006, never here.

**`cli/` IS IMPORT-CLOSED (binding invariant).** NOTHING under `cli/` may import from a sibling top-level directory — not `scripts/`, `config/`, `tests/`, `api/`, `packages/`, and not through a `@alias`. `cli/` is the updater's self-update component: `runUpdate` refreshes those files in place and re-execs the process BEFORE any other component is synced, so the NEW `cli/` runs against the target repo's OWN, old copy of everything else. An escaping import therefore bricks `bun run up` for anyone jumping more than one release — and because the failure is at module load, it takes `up --rollback`, `setup` and `setup:doctor` down with it, leaving no in-repo way out. Shared code goes in `cli/lib/`; a `scripts/` file that needs it imports FROM `cli/` (that direction is safe: `scripts/` is synced later, never re-exec'd mid-run). Enforced by the `no-restricted-imports` block scoped to `cli/**` in `eslint.config.js`, so `lint:check` catches it in CI, pre-push, and `repo:check`.

**HOOK: one emitter, three adapters.** `.agents/hooks/personality-reinject.mjs` holds the contract text once. Claude and Codex execute it as a command hook (stdout becomes developer context on both); OpenCode imports the constant from a thin plugin. The SAME emitter also resolves and injects one `AGENT IDENTITY:` line per prompt (worktree · session label · harness — the value `git-flow-master` copies into the `Worktree:` / `Session:` commit trailers of Rule #3) and, ONLY when the orchestration binary is present on the machine, one extra line naming `/orca-orchestration`. Binary absent = no line at all, which is the silence rule of the optional executor (§3). Still one emitter and three adapters: no second hook file, no per-harness copy of the text. Contract enforced by `cli/lib/agent-compatibility-contracts.ts`: no absolute personal paths, no duplicated hook file, OpenCode must mutate `output.system` in place. Codex's adapter carries `commandWindows` for PowerShell and resolves the repo via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.

**HUSKY: one synced gates file, two project-owned hooks.** `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push` are on the protected watchlist, so the project's own gates and their ordering survive every sync and nothing upstream overwrites them. The gates UPSTREAM owns are not in them: they live in `.husky/framework-gates.sh`, which IS synced, and each hook sources it and calls one function (`framework_gates_pre_commit` / `framework_gates_pre_push`). That is the only way a gate added upstream reaches a project scaffolded earlier — a never-overwritten hook cannot grow one, which is how four gates ended up running nowhere downstream. `lint-staged` stays in the hook, above the call: it REWRITES staged files, so it must finish before anything reads the staged list. The source is `[ -f ]`-guarded because `.husky/_/h` runs hooks under `sh -e`: sourcing a file that is not there would kill the hook, and a rollback or a half-applied sync can legitimately leave the hooks present and the gates file gone. A hook that predates the split gets a parity row with the exact block to paste.

**ROOT CONFIGS AND THE VARIABLES MODULE SHIP IN HALVES.** `tsconfig.base.json` and `eslint.config.base.js` are SYNCED and hold the path aliases, the `cli/` import-closure rule (`CLI_IMPORT_CLOSURE`) and the KATA alias-import rule that forbids `./` and `../` under `tests/**` (`KATA_IMPORT_ALIASES`), while `tsconfig.json` and `eslint.config.js` stay project-owned and extend or spread them. `config/variables.core.ts` is the same shape for the variables module: synced resolver and framework blocks, project-owned environment and URL map in `config/variables.ts`. Never hand-edit a `*.base.*` or `*.core.ts` file in a consumer repo — edit the project half. And note the asymmetry that makes a synced rule fail quietly: the base is SYNCED, but `eslint.config.js` is PROJECT-OWNED and never overwritten, so a block upstream adds arrives on disk while the wiring that activates it does not. `validateEslintBlockWiring` (`cli/lib/agent-compatibility-contracts.ts`) fails `agents:compat:check` when `eslint.config.js` does not name every scoped block `eslint.config.base.js` exports — without it, a shipped rule enforces nothing and `lint:check` stays green.

**MCP: one declared set, three formats, semantic parity.** The canonical server set is whatever `.mcp.json` declares: every server there must exist in `opencode.jsonc` and `.codex/config.toml` with the same `.env` dependencies and the same literal env settings, and a server present in one host only fails naming the server and the host. Parity is checked by NORMALIZING each native format (JSON / JSONC / TOML) into a common shape (transport, command, args, url, `.env` dependencies, literal env, enabled) then comparing. The servers the boilerplate ships (`KNOWN_MCP_IDS` in `cli/lib/agent-compatibility-contracts.ts`: the local ones plus the two that need no key) additionally get a strict per-host shape check whenever the project declares them; any other server gets the generic check only, so a downstream project may drop or add servers freely. Remote servers whose only project-side content was an API key (web search, Postman) are NOT committed: they run at harness level (a claude.ai connector, a user-scope MCP, the OpenCode / Codex user config), skills resolve them by capability, and `cli/lib/harness-level-mcps.ts` is the one list of them (ADR-0005). A downstream project that keeps one sees a parity row, never an overwrite. Env references keep each host's own syntax: `${VAR}` (`.mcp.json`), `{file:.auth/opencode/VAR}` (`opencode.jsonc`: placeholder files `bun install` creates, never an env reference), `env_vars` / `bearer_token_env_var` (`.codex/config.toml`, which never expands placeholders); Critical Rule #10 applies to all three. Per-MCP decision rules → §5.

**HARNESS-SPECIFIC GOTCHAS.**

- **Codex trust**: project `.codex/` config and hooks load ONLY in a trusted repository. `bun run setup:doctor` reports trust separately from file correctness, because trust is runtime state that cannot be verified by reading files.
- **Codex Desktop** consumes the same repository config as the CLI. No second convention, no extra directory.
- **OpenCode hook API** uses `experimental.chat.system.transform`. Official but experimental: re-verify on OpenCode upgrades. Claude and Codex sit on stable hook APIs.
- **Launch with `bun run claude` / `bun run opencode` / `bun run codex`** — each wraps `dotenv -o -e .env`, which forces `.env` to WIN over an inherited process variable. Launching the bare executable skips that and can leave a stale inherited value shadowing the file (§7).

## 5. SKILLS + MODES + MCPs REGISTRY

### Skill tiers (T1-T4)

Repo organizes skills in 4 tiers with different discovery + load rules:

- **T1**: Project-owned, committed in `.agents/skills/`. Listed below in "Workflow Skills". Load silent on trigger.
- **T2**: Project-vendored. Committed in `.agents/skills/` from upstream (e.g. `judgment-day` from gentle-ai). License + attribution preserved in frontmatter. Load silent on explicit trigger.
- **T3**: Community project-level. Installed by `install.ts` into `.agents/skills/` (not committed). Load silent if category matches task domain. `skill-creator` is T3 since the context-skills layer: it is ALWAYS the builder when this repo scaffolds a skill (`/framework-development` for a boilerplate skill, `project-context` mode `context-skill` for a consumer's `<aspect>-context`), so no clone runs without it.
- **T4**: Community user-level. Installed globally. ALWAYS ASK before loading.
- **Context skills** (`metadata.kind: context`, slug `<aspect>-context`): judgment over ONE aspect, citing `.context/` facts, never restating them (`agentic-qa-core/references/skill-scaffold.md` §3). Upstream ships exactly one, `iql-context` (the methodology index; adapted per project through `qa.methodology` in `.agents/project.yaml` and the bootstrap-only `references/project-overrides.md`). Every other `*-context` is project-local by construction: `bun run up` never delivers, overwrites or deletes it (`isProjectLocalSkillPath`, `cli/lib/updater-core.ts`). `project-discovery` PROPOSES them at close; `project-context` mode `context-skill` CREATES them through `skill-creator`; the skill resolver injects into a briefing only the context skills whose aspect the dispatch touches (`agentic-qa-core/references/skill-resolver.md`).

> **Orchestration vendor stubs are T4, OPTIONAL to HAVE and MANDATORY to LOAD when present.** The orchestration binary ships its own guides and installs them user-level; which ones is `orchestration.orchestrator_skills` in `.agents/project.yaml`, never a name hardcoded in a skill. They still gate NOTHING — availability is decided by the binary plus a reachable runtime, and a machine without them is fully capable because T1 `orca-orchestration` asks the binary for its grammar. They are loaded ALONGSIDE the T1 skill rather than fetched on demand, because they are small and a fetch-on-demand posture once cost a live fleet an iteration spent correcting an invented flag (ADR-0006). `install.ts` still does not install them — the binary owns that.

> Layout convention: T1 repo skills → `.agents/skills/<slug>/` (committed source). T3 community skills share that project store. Claude Code discovers the same tree through the generated `.claude/skills` alias; user-level T4 skills remain harness-specific. `install.ts` targets the canonical store for project skills and passes `--agent` only for user-level installs.

Full contract: `.agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md`

**gentle-ai install scope**: `cli/install.ts` runs `gentle-ai install --preset minimal` → installs ONLY the `engram` component (persistent memory). SDD-* skills are NOT installed by default: our workflow skills (`/sprint-testing`, `/test-automation`, `/test-documentation`, `/regression-testing`) cover Plan → Code → Verify natively without SDD ceremony. Users who explicitly want the SDD suite for framework evolution work can add it manually: `gentle-ai install --components engram,sdd --agent <a>`.

### Skills (lazy-loaded by trigger phrase)

This table is the trigger ROUTER, not the inventory: tiers, kinds, flags and full descriptions live in `.agents/skills/REGISTRY.md` (generated by `bun run skills:registry`) and in each `SKILL.md` frontmatter. `bun run skills:check` (`TIER-MISMATCH`) fails when a community skill declared in `cli/install.ts` has no row here, so the rows are gated, never hand-reconciled.

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `agentic-qa-core` | (auto, cited by other skills) | Foundation: passive reference host for shared doctrine (briefing template, dispatch patterns, orchestration, skill-composition strategy). Loaded on demand by workflow skills. |
| `agentic-qa-onboard` | `/agentic-qa-onboard` | First-time orientation tour. Explains stack + 6-stage pipeline + MCPs. Hands off to right downstream skill. ALSO the teaching front-desk for confused users: suspends caveman, explains in plain human language, and offers to open the per-skill `how-it-works.es.html` visual decks in the browser (ask first). |
| `framework-development` | `/framework-development` | Framework-evolution orchestrator for the boilerplate itself (KATA bases, fixtures, cli/, scripts/, api/schemas/ pipeline). NOT for per-ticket QA. Self-contained Plan → Code → Verify → Archive pipeline; runs under `gentle-ai install --preset minimal` (no SDD-* skills required). |
| `project-discovery` | `/project-discovery` | 4-phase discovery (Constitution → Architecture → Infrastructure → Specification) → generates PRD, SRS, domain glossary, `.context/`. Reverse-engineering only. |
| `project-context` | `project-context`, "business data map", "business feature map", "business API map", "master test plan" | Regenerates data, feature, API, and test-plan artifacts through isolated modes or ordered `refresh-all`. UPDATE mode requires approval before overwrite. |
| `sync-ai-context` | `sync-ai-context`, "sync AI memory" | Synchronizes AI-critical repository docs against canonical instructions, skills, aliases, context, and `package.json`; never modifies Engram memory. |
| `adapt-framework` | `/adapt-framework` | Idempotent KATA adaptation with no-write analysis and plan before explicit approval and mutation. |
| `jira-administration` | `jira-administration`, "sync Jira components", "Jira instance migration" | Isolated Components and instance-migration modes, each sealed behind read-first analysis and explicit approval. |
| `shift-left-testing` | `/shift-left-testing` | Stage 0: pre-sprint Shift-Left QA on a batch of backlog Stories. Refines ACs, surfaces gaps/ambiguities, authors the Story's ATP early field-first into `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` (no Test Plan item pre-sprint — `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 creates the item from the field and refines; no separate DRAFT artifact), tracks each Story's pass via a `[QA] Shift-Left Review` subtask (In Progress → Done; session notes live there, Story stays clean), transitions `backlog → shift_left_qa → estimation`. Adds labels `shift-left-reviewed` + `shift-left-{YYYY-MM-DD}` so `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 can short-circuit Phases 1-3 later. |
| `sprint-testing` | `/sprint-testing` | Stages 1-3: manual QA per issue (Planning, Execution, Reporting). Two modes: `single-issue` (one key) and `sprint-wide` (a sprint number → JQL over the project's OWN declared coverable work types). Produces PBI folder, ATP, ATR, bug reports; sprint-wide state is the STP in Jira (description = plan, comments = append-only progress), local scaffolding only in `.session/sprint-testing/sprint-<N>/{plan,progress}.md`. |
| `test-documentation` | `/test-documentation` | Stage 4: TMS docs + ROI scoring. Produces Candidate / Manual / Deferred verdicts. |
| `test-automation` | `/test-automation` | Stage 5: Plan → Code → Review on KATA + Playwright + TypeScript. |
| `regression-testing` | `/regression-testing` | Stage 6: regression / smoke / sanity via CI/CD. Classifies failures. Emits GO / CAUTION / NO-GO. |
| `playwright-cli` | `/playwright-cli` | Browser CLI: screenshots, tracing, video, session mgmt, request mocking. *(community: installed at PROJECT level by `cli/install.ts`; not committed in repo)* |
| `playwright-best-practices` | `/playwright-best-practices` | Reference skill: flaky-test fixes, POM, accessibility (axe-core), auth/OAuth, fixtures, tags (`@smoke`/`@critical`), perf budgets, i18n, component testing. Auto-loads alongside `/test-automation`. *(community: installed at PROJECT level by `cli/install.ts`; not committed in repo)* |
| `bug-screenshot-annotation` | "annotate bug screenshot", "mark up evidence", "anota este bug", "marca la captura" | Turns a raw bug screenshot into QA-style annotated evidence (circles/arrows/callouts/corner badge/axis ticks) via HTML+CSS overlays rendered 100% locally (loopback HTTP + playwright-cli capture, NEVER an external image service). Loaded inline by `/sprint-testing` Stage 2 for visual/positional bugs; can auto-embed the result into the Jira bug via the acli media helper. |
| `skill-creator` | (loaded by `/framework-development` when the change IS a skill, and by `project-context` mode `context-skill`) | The builder of every skill this repo scaffolds: draft, test prompts, evals, description pass; the scaffold contract itself lives in `agentic-qa-core/references/skill-scaffold.md`. *(community: installed at PROJECT level by `cli/install.ts`; not committed in repo)* |
| `resend-cli` | `/resend-cli` | Resend email testing CLI. Pairs with the `resend` external binary. *(community: installed at PROJECT level by `cli/install.ts`; not committed in repo)* |

| `acli` | `/acli` | Atlassian CLI. Resolves `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` and `[TMS_TOOL]` (Modality jira-native). |
| `git-flow-master` | (auto on git/PR intents) | End-to-end Git operator. Auto-detects branching strategy. Owns branch / commit / push / PR / conflict / chained-PR. |
| `orca-orchestration` | `/orca-orchestration`, "orchestrate", "fleet", "workers", "resume the run", "orquestar", "lanza workers", "una sesión por historia", "comunícate con el worker" | Multi-session orchestration layer (CONDUCTOR / WORKER / AUTOMATION modes) over the `orca` binary: launches persistent supervised workers, coordinates them through the run mailbox, owns worktree provisioning and the claims protocol. OPTIONAL by construction — gate = binary + reachable runtime; workflow skills stay silent and fall back to their `launch.txt` when it fails. Owns the `orchestration:` block in `.agents/project.yaml`. |
| `session-handoff` | `/session-handoff`, "hagamos el handoff", "handoff", "pasa el contexto a otra sesión", "hand this session over", "continue this in a fresh session" | Compacts a whole session into `.session/handoffs/<session-name>-handoff-NN.md` so a NEW session resumes exactly where this one stopped, then launches that successor in the SAME worktree and the SAME harness. Ownership transfer of a SESSION: no Run, no Task, no Dispatch, no mailbox. Primary trigger is manual by owner preference; what each harness does and does not expose about context size is settled with citations in the skill's `references/auto-trigger.md`. |
| `judgment-day` | `/judgment-day`, `juzgar`, `dual review` | T2 vendored from gentle-ai (Apache-2.0). Adversarial dual-judge review (2 blind judges in parallel, synthesis, fix loop, re-judge). Cited as optional gate by `/test-automation` Phase 3 + `/git-flow-master` pre-PR. Never auto-invoked. |
| `iql-context` | (auto, kind `context`: "why is the process shaped this way", "what is a stage / phase / altitude", "IQL", "TMLC / TALC", "light mode") | The methodology index: eight named stages, the artifact ladder (MTP / FTP / STP / ATP / ATS / ATR / STR / RTP / RTR), the invariants and where each is enforced, the agentic contract; cites `agentic-qa-core/references/*` and the official site, restates nothing. Shipped upstream; adapted per project through `qa.methodology` (`.agents/project.yaml`) + the bootstrap-only `references/project-overrides.md`. Knowledge only: never runs a stage. |
| `pr-review-lead` | `pr-review-lead`, "review this PR", "revisa este PR" | QA Lead / QA Architect review of a PR's test-automation work against KATA doctrine (or the target repo's own doctrine) — every finding grounded in a doctrine citation or code location. Works on this repo or external repos (`owner/repo#PR` via `gh`). Runs a strictness preflight (Flexible / Standard / Strict); never posts to GitHub without explicit final OK. NOT for reviewing your own uncommitted diff (default code-review flow) or blind dual review (`/judgment-day`). |

### Skill modes

A multi-mode skill lists its modes in its own `## Mode routing` section, and that section is the only list. Invoke it by name plus mode: `/project-context data` on Claude Code, "load `project-context`, mode `data`" on OpenCode and Codex. The first token of `$ARGUMENTS` that matches a mode IS the mode and the rest is forwarded; no matching token means the skill asks (or applies its declared default). A former command name (`break-down-tests`, `business-data-map`, `sync-ai-memory`) survives only as a trigger phrase in its skill's `description`.

### MCPs (decision rules)

Each row is a CAPABILITY skills declare (`metadata.requires_capabilities`) and resolve by tool-name suffix, so a user-level server or a claude.ai connector exposing the same tools satisfies the row; the committed server that provides it is whatever `.mcp.json` declares (`KNOWN_MCP_IDS` in `cli/lib/agent-compatibility-contracts.ts`): canon `agentic-qa-core/references/mcp-capabilities.md`.

| Capability | Use for | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `browser` | E2E, UI automation, screenshots | Fallback for `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` (primary = `/playwright-cli`) |
| `api-schema` | API **schema** read-only (endpoint discovery, request/response contracts) | `[API_TOOL]` schema-read leg ONLY. Authenticated execution is `curl`, NOT the MCP: see `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md`. |
| `db` | DB queries, data validation | `[DB_TOOL]` primary |
| `library-docs` | Library official docs ("how to use X") | `[DOCS_TOOL]` primary. **MANDATORY** for any library / framework / SDK / API / CLI doc lookup (React, Next, Playwright, Prisma, Tailwind, Express, etc.). PREFER OVER built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`: a library-docs MCP returns current versioned docs; built-in web search returns stale blog posts. |
| `web-search` (HARNESS-LEVEL: a claude.ai connector or a user-scope server, not `.mcp.json`) | Community solutions ("how to solve X"), troubleshooting, non-doc web research | `[WEB_SEARCH_TOOL]` primary. **MANDATORY** for any general web search: community fixes, error message lookups, "how to solve X". PREFER OVER built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`: a search MCP returns ranked + summarized results; built-in is shallower. No provider available → point-of-use STOP (Rule #10). |

---

## 6. TOOL RESOLUTION ([TAG_TOOL] pseudocode)

> Skills use `[TAG_TOOL]` pseudocode. Resolve via this table. **PRIORITY**: CLI tools first (fewer tokens). MCP = fallback only.

| Tag | Domain | Primary | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` | Jira Cloud (story / bug / epic) | `/acli` | MCP Atlassian (opt-in: `agentic-qa-core/references/mcp-atlassian-optin.md`) |
| `[TMS_TOOL]` | Test management | Modality jira-xray: `/xray-cli`. Modality jira-native: `/acli` | MCP Atlassian (opt-in: `agentic-qa-core/references/mcp-atlassian-optin.md`) |
| `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` | Browser automation | `/playwright-cli` | MCP Playwright |
| `[DB_TOOL]` | Database | DBHub MCP | Supabase MCP / raw SQL |
| `[API_TOOL]` | API testing | **Schema read**: OpenAPI MCP (read-only). **Execute**: `curl` (token via `bun run api:login` → `.auth/tokens.env`). Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md` | Postman (a harness-level MCP the user connects; never in the project MCP files) |
| `[DOCS_TOOL]` | Library / framework / SDK / API / CLI official docs | Capability `library-docs`: any MCP tool whose name ENDS in `resolve-library-id` → `query-docs`, whichever server exposes it (project `.mcp.json` → `mcp__context7__…`; a claude.ai connector → `mcp__claude_ai_<name>__…`) | built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` ONLY when the user chooses it after the point-of-use STOP |
| `[WEB_SEARCH_TOOL]` | General web search, community fixes, troubleshooting, non-doc research | Capability `web-search`: any MCP tool whose name ENDS in `tavily_search` / `tavily_extract` / `tavily_research`, whichever server exposes it (a claude.ai connector → `mcp__claude_ai_<name>__…`; a user-scope server → `mcp__<its name>__…`). The server lives at HARNESS level, never in the project MCP files (ADR-0005) | built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` ONLY when the user chooses it after the point-of-use STOP |
| `[ORCHESTRATION_TOOL]` | Multi-session orchestration: launch / supervise / message / close persistent workers, worktrees, runs, automations | `/orca-orchestration` (owns the `orca` binary grammar; gate = binary + reachable runtime) | one-shot subagents (§3) + the skill's `launch.txt` lines pasted into terminals by hand |

> **Reads-vs-writes carve-out**: the `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` / `[TMS_TOOL]` rows resolve to the WRITE / transition / link / trivial-lookup tool. DETAILED CONTENT reads (custom fields, ACs, ATP/ATR, comments) instead route through `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` / `jql "<query>"`: read the synced `.md` (`acli view` returns null for `customfield_*`). Traceability link-graph + Xray run status stay on `/acli` / `/xray-cli`. See §9 and `agentic-qa-core/references/acli-integration.md`.

**MANDATORY**: LOAD owning skill BEFORE invoking its tool. Skills = WHEN/WHAT. HOW (syntax, flags, auth, errors) lives in skill's `references/`. A tool-name PREFIX is a server name, the SUFFIX is the capability: resolve every MCP capability by suffix, never by prefix (`mcp__tavily__tavily_search`, `mcp__claude_ai_<name>__tavily_search` and a user-level server's `…__tavily_search` all provide `web-search`); no available tool provides it → STOP at the point of use per `agentic-qa-core/references/preflight-gate.md` §8, canon `agentic-qa-core/references/mcp-capabilities.md`.

- Before any `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL] ...` → load `/acli`
- Before any `[TMS_TOOL] ...` Modality jira-xray → load `/xray-cli`
- Before any `[TMS_TOOL] ...` Modality jira-native → load `/acli`
- Before any `[AUTOMATION_TOOL] ...` → load `/playwright-cli`
- Before any `[API_TOOL] ...` → the OpenAPI MCP is **schema-read-only** (discover endpoints + read schemas); load `agentic-qa-core/references/api-testing-doctrine.md` for the schema → `bun run api:login` → `curl` maneuver. Execute authenticated requests with curl, NEVER via the MCP.
- Before any `[DOCS_TOOL] ...` → use the `library-docs` tools directly, any prefix (no skill load: MCP self-documents). NEVER substitute with `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` for library docs.
- Before any `[WEB_SEARCH_TOOL] ...` → use the `web-search` tools directly (any prefix). NEVER substitute with built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` on your own: no provider → point-of-use STOP, the user chooses.
- Before any `[ORCHESTRATION_TOOL] ...` → load `/orca-orchestration`. Workflow skills write the pseudocode and NEVER the literal command; the HOW (verbs, flags, gate, cleanup) lives in that skill's `references/`. Gate fails → no mention, no recommendation: run the documented fallback.

**TMS modality fallback** (resolved by `test-documentation/SKILL.md` §Phase 0):

| Modality | `[TMS_TOOL]` resolves to | TMS entities |
|---|---|---|
| A: Xray on Jira | `/xray-cli` for Xray entities; `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` for generic Jira | Test, Test Plan, Test Execution, Pre-Condition |
| B: Jira-native (no Xray) | NOT resolvable → falls through to `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` (`/acli`) | ATP/ATR = Story custom fields + comments; TCs = Jira `Test` issues. See `test-documentation/references/jira-setup.md` |

Skills using `[TMS_TOOL]` MUST include parallel pseudocode branches for both modalities (labeled "Modality jira-native").

**Pseudocode value types**: `Literal` (fixed domain) · `{per convention}` (consult skill ref) · `{{PROJECT_VAR}}` (from `.agents/project.yaml`) · `{from analysis}` (runtime-derived).

## 6.5. CLI → SKILL AUTO-LOAD MAPPING

> Bash invokes these binaries → LOAD matching skill BEFORE running. Skill holds WHEN/WHAT; binary executes HOW. Missing load = flying blind on syntax, flags, auth, errors.

| CLI invoked | Skill(s) to load BEFORE invoking |
|---|---|
| `gh` | `/git-flow-master` (in-repo, when command is git/PR-shaped) |
| `acli` | `/acli` (in-repo) |
| `playwright-cli` | `/playwright-cli` (community PROJECT) + `/playwright-best-practices` (community PROJECT) |
| `bunx allure` (run/agent/generate/open/watch) | `/regression-testing` (in-repo) + `/test-automation` (in-repo) |
| `resend` | `/resend-cli` (community PROJECT) |
| `jq` | `/acli` (primary consumer of jq pipelines) |
| `bun` | `/bun` (community USER) |
| `bun xray` | `/xray-cli` (in-repo). `test enrich` backfills the synced Test `.md` cache with the Xray-internal associations the REST sync cannot see: inlined Preconditions + Test Set membership |
| `supabase` / `wrangler` / `vercel` | `/regression-testing` (in-repo — private report hosting; protocol: `regression-testing/references/private-hosting-setup.md`) |
| `orca` | `/orca-orchestration` (in-repo). That skill holds WHEN/WHAT; the stubs in `orchestration.orchestrator_skills` load ALONGSIDE it (they are small), and the DEEP topics stay served by the binary on demand, never copied into the repo |

**RULE**: Before any Bash call naming these binaries, check matching skill loaded. If not → load via Skill tool first. Hard gate, not suggestion.

---

## 7. PROJECT VARIABLES: POINTER

> ALL variable syntax + Jira field references documented in **`.agents/README.md`**. READ ONCE per session, cache values.

Project values live in **`.agents/project.yaml`**: load once per session, cache. NEVER hardcode identity, env URLs, Jira URL, project key, MCP names.

**Variable syntaxes** (full ref → `.agents/README.md`):

- `{{VAR_NAME}}` → static project var (flat or env-scoped via `environments[active_env].<var>`). Examples: `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, `{{WEB_URL}}`, `{{environments.<env>.web_url}}`.
- `<<VAR_NAME>>` → session var computed at runtime (e.g. `<<ISSUE_KEY>>` from git branch). Never persisted.
- `{{jira.*}}` → Jira custom fields + workflow refs (see `.agents/jira-fields.json`, `jira-workflows.json`, `jira-required.yaml`). Sub-forms: `{{jira.<slug>.<option>}}`, `{{jira.work_type.<slug>}}`, `{{jira.transition.<work_type>.<slug>}}`.

**Active env**: `active_env` defaults to `testing.default_env` in `.agents/project.yaml`. User says "test against production" → switch `active_env` to `production` for that session, ignore `default_env` until session ends.

**INSTANCE-IDENTITY ANCHOR (binding)**: the Atlassian host is `.agents/project.yaml` → `issue_tracker.atlassian_url` and **NOWHERE ELSE locally**. `ATLASSIAN_URL` is NOT a `.env` variable: it is absent from `.env` and `.env.example` on purpose, because a second copy is what goes stale. Canonical resolver: `cli/lib/atlassian-instance.ts`, never read `process.env.ATLASSIAN_URL` directly in a new script. From a shell, call the accessor: `bun run --silent jira:url` (base URL) / `--slug` (bare host for `acli --site`; NEVER hand-strip `https://`). This binds the TEST RUNTIME too: `config/variables.ts` resolves the host through the same resolver, so `config.tms.jira.url` — which the Jira-Direct TMS provider uses to WRITE results back onto issues — cannot be misdirected by an inherited variable. The resolver still reads the env var LAST as a transitional fallback for a repo whose yaml is unset; on disagreement the yaml wins AND a warning names both values, because a hit there means a stale copy is loose in the environment. **Deliberate inversion vs. `project_key`**, where the env var wins: a project key is a legitimate per-run override, the host is project identity that changes on site migrations: the exact value that goes stale. Credentials (`ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`, `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`) stay env-only and are NEVER mirrored into the versioned yaml; the host is a public hostname, not a secret, so the reverse split is safe. `scripts/agents-setup.ts` refuses to seed this one field from the environment (`envVar: null`) so an unattended run can never overwrite the versioned value. The NAME survives only as an optional CI variable, pushed FROM the yaml by `bun run setup --variables` (manifest `valueSource: 'atlassian-instance'`); `regression.yml` deliberately has no `ATLASSIAN_URL` secret, since CI reads the checked-out yaml. Class-wide guard: `bun run vars:env:check` fails on ANY `.env`-sourced manifest var whose process value differs from `.env`, and warns when a yaml-sourced var still has a dead line in `.env`. Applies the test: **does a stale value here corrupt data in silence, or fail loudly?** Silent corruption → one versioned source, no local duplicate, is not optional. Since the variables split, `config/variables.ts` resolves the host through `config/variables.core.ts`, which is SYNCED, so a project that adapted its environment map still receives resolver fixes.

## 8. AI BEHAVIOR DURING TESTING

1. **EXPLAIN THE STORY**: once ticket understood, briefly state: what feature is, how works (simple terms), what will be tested.
2. **WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION**: after important explanations, WAIT for user response before continuing.
3. **EXPLAIN DEFECTS**: bug / unexpected behavior → describe observed, explain why problem, suggest impact (severity, affected users, business risk).
4. **TEST-DESIGN DOCTRINE (binding)**: verifying ACs is the FLOOR, not testing. Coverage = AC-conformance + risk-beyond-AC. One AC → multiple cases by default (1:N); collapse to one only with a written `trivially atomic` justification. Derive cases by technique-trigger: EP always; BVA on ranges/limits; State-Transition on status fields; Decision Table on 2+ interacting conditions; Pairwise on 3+ factors. Never report "% of ACs verified" as completeness. Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/test-design-doctrine.md`.
5. **DEFECT-MANAGEMENT DOCTRINE (binding)**: classify every quality issue as Bug / Defect / Improvement by the FEATURE's lifecycle stage, NOT where it was found (Bug = feature already live above Staging; Defect = still pre-release; Improvement = not a broken AC: an enhancement or under-/un-specified AC surfaced by a test-beyond-AC). Set `qa_assignee` to self (never overwrite an existing owner: read-before-write) on every work item (story / tech_story / tech_debt / bug / defect / improvement). Components are mandatory (affected product module). Parent quality issues to the QA PROCESS epic: "QA Defect Management" for bug/defect/improvement, "QA Test Repository" for Test issues, "QA Master Test Plan" for Test Plans (FTP/STP/ATP/RTP), "QA Test Artifacts" for Test Executions (STR/ATR/RTR) + Preconditions + Test Sets (mandatory per-Story `ATS: {US_ID}` Acceptance Test Set, components inherited from the Story; feature-level `TS:` optional; real, parentable Jira issues — but their Test associations / Set membership are Xray-internal, read via `bun xray test enrich`), NEVER a product/dev epic; carry the source Story via an issue-link. Fill the mandatory field matrix; auto-derive Priority from Severity. Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md`.
6. **ARTIFACT LIFECYCLE (binding)**: every artifact the harness creates has a DECLARED lifecycle and MUST leave the status Jira's `create` transition dropped it in. An ATP frozen at `Planning`, an ATS at `Designing`, an ATR at `ACTIVE` or a TC at `Draft` after the stage that owns it closed is a DEFECT, not cosmetics: it tells the team the work never happened. Set `assignee` = self on every QA artifact AT CREATE TIME (Xray refuses membership edits on a Test Plan the caller does not own — an unassigned Plan is a blocker waiting to happen); ask before touching one someone else owns. Slug missing for this project → run the unmapped-status fallback: list the LIVE transitions, propose the closest synonym in ONE `AskUserQuestion`, fire the live id on the user's OK, then recommend `bun run jira:sync-workflows`. NEVER skip silently, NEVER guess an id, NEVER hand-edit `.agents/jira-workflows.json`. Every stage closes with the light stage verifier (artifacts · links · statuses · assignee · parent+components · fields written · progress checkpoint · session footer), each line YES or a STATED N/A. Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/artifact-lifecycle.md`.
7. **LANGUAGE**: see §1 #14 LANGUAGE DETECTION + MIRRORING (canonical rule).
8. **SESSION CLOSE (every workflow skill, unprompted)**: surface repo-relative paths of every screenshot/bug-annotation captured (in-flow, the instant one exists, never wait to be asked) + a session-close footer of skills/MCPs/CLIs used and testing-pyramid levels touched (explicit "none" per untouched level). Printed in CHAT only, never in a Jira comment/ATR. Full contract + templates: `agentic-qa-core/references/session-footer-contract.md`.

**ENVIRONMENT SELECTION**: canonical environment identifiers are `local` · `qa` · `staging` · `production` (lowercase, no abbreviations, never `prod`, `stg`, `uat`, unless a project genuinely adds its own). Default **staging** unless user specifies otherwise. Ask when ambiguous. URLs from `.agents/project.yaml`. Credentials from `.env`.

**CONTEXT EFFICIENCY**: main conversation stays lean. Subagents do heavy reading. Skills load only references current phase needs.

---

## 9. LOCAL CONTEXT (PBI)

> **`.context/PBI/` is a GITIGNORED CACHE of Jira, owned by `scripts/sync-jira-issues.ts`.** Module = Epic (1:1). Jira is the source of truth. NEVER hand-write a Jira-mirrored file: generate content, push it to the Jira field (or fallback), then run the sync. Rebuild the whole tree with `bun run context:hydrate`.

> **WHY IT IS NOT COMMITTED**: this content regenerates. Two sessions that re-sync at different times produce conflicting commits of the same generated text, and a 3-way merge over a full-file rewrite is meaningless. Jira already is the versioned, shared, cloud-hosted copy — committing it duplicates the database into git and buys nothing.

**THREE TIERS** — every path under `.context/PBI/` is exactly one of these. Check before creating any file:

| Tier | Source of truth | In git? | Recovered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[SYNC]` | Jira | No | `bun run context:hydrate` |
| `[COMMIT]` | This repo | **Yes** | `git checkout` |
| `[LOCAL]` | Nothing durable | No | Not recovered — disposable by design |

`[LOCAL]` files may be hand-written, but **nothing downstream may depend on one existing**: it lives only on the machine that made it. A skill that needs to read it on another machine must put the content in Jira instead. `test-session-memory.md` is NOT in this tree — it lives at `.session/sprint-testing/<scope>/` so a re-sync cannot clobber it.

**GITIGNORE LADDER** (git cannot re-include a file whose parent dir is excluded, so it descends level by level — collapsing this to a plain `.context/PBI/` silently drops `test-specs/` from version control):

The lines are in `.gitignore` (search `.context/PBI/`): one exclude and one re-include per level, down to `epics/*/test-specs/`.

Verify any change with `git check-ignore -v` on both a `test-specs/` file (must NOT be ignored) and a `stories/.../story.md` (must be ignored).

> **QA-process parenting (3-axis model).** In Jira, every `bug` / `defect` / `improvement` parents to the QA process epic **"QA Defect Management"** (every `Test` issue to **"QA Test Repository"**, every **Test Plan** FTP/STP/ATP/RTP to **"QA Master Test Plan"** (itself an Epic, not a Test Plan work type), and every **Test Execution** STR/ATR/RTR + Precondition + Test Set to **"QA Test Artifacts"** — incl. the mandatory per-Story `ATS: {US_ID}` Acceptance Test Set (components inherited from the Story; feature-level `TS:` optional)), NEVER a product/dev epic. Preconditions + Test Sets are real Jira issues (parentable via `acli`); their Test↔Precondition association and Test Set membership are Xray-internal — read via `bun xray test enrich`. Traceability to the source Story is carried by an **issue-link**, and the affected product area by **components**: three separate axes (parent = QA bucket · link = source Story · components = product module). Canon: `agentic-qa-core/references/defect-management-doctrine.md`.

**Canonical tree** (Epic-centric; `<KEY>` = Jira key, `<slug>` from summary):

**`pull` scope is declared per work type via `work_types.*.sync` in `.agents/jira-required.yaml`** (shipped default: Epic + Story + Bug); `--types` / `JIRA_SYNC_TYPES` extend it. **Coverable** types (Story, Bug, Defect, Improvement, Tech Story, Tech Debt) each get their OWN folder: body md + `acceptance-test-plan.md` + `acceptance-test-results.md` + `test-executions/` (only when >1 Execution linked) + nested `defects/`. **ATP/ATR precedence** (items-first: a **Test Plan** item for ATP / **Test Execution** item for ATR by excellence; the Story custom field is fallback only): linked Xray Test Plan desc (ATP) / Test Execution / Re-Test Execution desc (ATR) OVERRIDE the Story custom-field copy → else issue field → else Jira comment (only `--include-comments`) → else silent. **The two tiebreaks are ASYMMETRIC — "newest wins" is the ATR rule only**: with several Executions linked the ATR is the one with the most recent `fields.updated`, but with several Test Plans linked the ATP is simply the FIRST in raw Jira link order (a warning names the chosen key). So re-linking a Story's Test Plans in a different order silently changes which ATP body becomes canonical — read that warning, do not assume recency decided it. Sync emits end-of-run **traceability WARNINGS** for ATP/ATR linked via the wrong link type, atypical Defect links, and orphan Defects with no coverable parent.

**HIGHER-ALTITUDE SWEEP**: FTP / STP / STR sit ABOVE a Story, so the coverage walk structurally cannot reach them — and the Story-altitude guard is right to keep skipping them there, because an FTP linked to a Story is not that Story's ATP. An unfiltered `pull` therefore ALSO sweeps the CHILDREN of the four QA-process Epics (resolved by the `QA-Artifact` label → cached `qa.qa_epics.*.key` → `QA ` name prefix; no new config), materializing the higher-altitude Plans and Runs plus Test Sets and Preconditions into the dirs above. Coverables, Tests and Story-altitude `ATP:` Plans are excluded: each already has a canonical home, and sweeping them would write a second copy of the same body. Skip with `--no-qa-artifacts`; a project with no QA-process Epics runs zero extra queries. Rationale: `.context/ADR/ADR-0001-artifact-ladder-local-cache.md`.

**`sync:` is a declaration, not a hint**: `default` = swept by a plain `pull` · `discovery` = materializes only on an explicit `get`/`jql`, through a link, or via the QA-epic sweep · `never` = the sync REFUSES to write it and names the declaration that stopped it. `test_set` and `precondition` moved `never` → `discovery`, because the code was writing them on `get` while the yaml claimed otherwise.

**`[SYNC]` files = forbidden to hand-write** (overwritten on every sync: NO file is hard-protected; Jira is the source of truth). **Rule of thumb**: file mirrors a Jira/Xray field → read the synced copy, never author it locally. File holds info NOT in Jira → author it locally, then decide its tier: does another machine need it? `[COMMIT]`. Only this session? `[LOCAL]`.

**MODULE CONTEXT → EPIC DESCRIPTION.** No custom field: skills APPEND a `## Module Context (QA)` section to the Epic `description` (read-first, never overwrite the PO's text) and the sync splits that section out into `module-context.md`. `description` exists on every Jira instance, so this works on a project that provisions zero custom fields.

**TESTS APPEAR EXACTLY ONCE.** A `Test` reachable from a coverable issue materializes under that issue's `test-cases/`; placement resolves by the cascade `TC→ATS→Story` (primary) → `TC→ATP→Story` (placement-only) → direct `TC→Story` (last-resort) → else `epics/_orphans/tests/` (cascade implemented by the Session-B sync work; doctrine canon: traceability-linking). Orphans — Tests with no path to any coverable — are themselves a coverage smell worth seeing; re-linking one in Jira moves it under its Story on the next sync.

**ONE ATP PER STORY.** Field-first: `/shift-left-testing` authors the pre-sprint ATP ONLY into `{{jira.acceptance_test_plan}}` (no Test Plan item yet); `/sprint-testing` Stage 1 creates the Test Plan item FROM that field and refines the SAME field + item into the executable superset. No `(Shift-Left DRAFT)` title variant. The pre-sprint pass is marked by the `shift-left-reviewed` + `shift-left-{YYYY-MM-DD}` labels. Stage 1's short-circuit reads the SYNCED `acceptance-test-plan.md` — never a local scratch file, which would be missing on any other machine and would degrade the short-circuit silently.

**DETAILED READS via the script** (replaces `acli view` for custom fields):
- `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments` → one issue, ALL custom fields + comments → read the generated `.md`.
- `bun run jira:sync-issues jql "<query>"` → batch. `pull --epic <KEY>` / `--story <KEY>` → scoped. New flags: `--sprint <active|current|closed|>=N|7,8,10>` (sprint filter), `--types <csv>` (extra coverable types), `--no-defects` (skip defect discovery), `--no-qa-artifacts` (skip the QA-process-epic sweep), `--project <KEY>` (override key). Env defaults: `JIRA_SYNC_SPRINTS`, `JIRA_SYNC_TYPES` (flag > env > default).
- Traceability (link graph Story↔ATP↔ATR↔TC) + Xray run status STAY on `acli`/`xray-cli`: the script only mirrors field content.

**FALLBACK**: if a custom field a skill must fill is absent from the instance, the skill writes the content as a structured Jira comment (`## <label>`) per `.agents/jira-required.yaml` → `fallback:`. The sync then emits a pointer stub for that field's `.md`. Never block on a missing field.

**COLD CLONE**: a fresh checkout has an almost-empty `.context/PBI/` (this README, `templates/`, committed `test-specs/`). That is the intended state. `bun run context:hydrate` rebuilds the cache; it needs `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL` / `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN` in `.env` plus the host from `.agents/project.yaml` → `issue_tracker.atlassian_url` (§7 anchor; validate with `bun run jira:check`). Someone without Jira access keeps an empty cache and can still review `test-specs/`, run the suite, and work on framework code — but not per-ticket QA.

**ENTRY POINT**: invoke `/sprint-testing`: syncs the ticket (`jira:sync-issues get`), explains story, loads the synced PBI, explores code.

**RESUME SESSION**: invoke `/test-automation`. Skill reads `PROGRESS.md` + `ROADMAP.md` automatically, picks up where left off.

**Project-wide context** (Level 1, generated):

```
.context/business/business-data-map.md       (project-context mode data)
.context/business/business-feature-map.md    (project-context mode features)
.context/business/business-api-map.md        (project-context mode api)
.context/master-test-plan.md                 (project-context mode test-plan)
api/schemas/                                 (bun run api:sync)
```

## 10. KATA QUICK-REFERENCE

> **FULL KATA + TypeScript rules**: `.agents/skills/test-automation/references/kata-architecture.md` + `.../typescript-patterns.md`. LOAD `/test-automation` BEFORE writing or reviewing any test code.

KATA layer flow:

```
TestContext (L1: config, faker, agnostic utils)
  ↓ extends
ApiBase / UiBase (L2: HTTP / Playwright helpers)
  ↓ extends
YourApi / YourPage (L3: ATCs live here)
  ↓ used by
TestFixture (L4: dependency injection)
  ↓ used by
Test files (orchestrate ATCs)
```

**Hard rules** (full detail in skill refs: load `/test-automation`):

- ATC = complete mini-flow, atomic, NEVER calls another ATC. Reusable chains → Steps module.
- Max 2 positional params. 3+ → object param.
- Locators inline in ATC. Extract only if used 2+ times.
- Imports use aliases (`@api/`, `@schemas/`, `@utils/`). No relative imports.
- Public methods: fail fast. Utilities: silent fail (return null).
- Fixture selection: API only → `{ api }` (no browser). UI only → `{ ui }`. Hybrid → `{ test }`.
- **Repo-relative paths in `scripts/` go through `scripts/lib/posix-path.ts`** (`toPosix` / `relativePosix`). `relative()` and `join()` emit `\` on Windows, and this repo has shipped that bug repeatedly (ADR-0006; downstream issue #26). **Exception: path GUARDS compare in the platform's own `sep`, never normalised**, because normalising a traversal prefix is how a `\` candidate slips past a `/` prefix.
- `scripts/api-login.project.ts` may export an optional `authenticate` hook that replaces the core's single POST for auth flows a single request cannot express. It is a LAST RESORT: a project that adopts it stops receiving upstream improvements to the request phase. Prefer `buildAuthPayload`.
- DRY scope: `api/schemas/` = OpenAPI facades. `tests/utils/` = agnostic utilities only. `UiBase` = all Playwright/Page helpers. `ApiBase` = all HTTP helpers. `TestContext` = shared across both.

## 11. GIT WORKFLOW: POINTERS

Git / PR work → `/git-flow-master` auto-loads. Details in `.agents/skills/git-flow-master/`. **No legacy git-flow doc applies**: the live policy is the `git_strategy:` block in `.agents/project.yaml`, enforced by `bun run git:policy verify` (the removed doc and its `staging` assumption: ADR-0006).

**Active strategy + branch policy = the `git_strategy:` block in `.agents/project.yaml`** (source of truth; see `## Git Strategy` below).

**Protected branches** (`/git-flow-master` reads `git_strategy.protected` in `.agents/project.yaml`; falls back to detecting whatever branches exist on the remote):

| Branch | Status | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Always | Production + default branch. The only branch in `git_strategy.protected`. In a `solo-main` flow work lands by DIRECT push when `git_strategy.policy.direct_push_to_protected` is `allowed` (see `## Git Strategy`); a PR from a semantic branch is optional, for when a review gate is wanted. |
| `staging` | Optional | Only if team adopts a main-integration flow. Integration branch for AI commits + pre-release validation. Does NOT exist on `origin` by default: do not assume it. |

**Critical commit rules**:

- Semantic prefixes: `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `test:` / `refactor:` / `chore:`
- One commit = one responsibility. Clear messages.
- **NO AI attribution** in commits.
- **Forensic trailers, every commit, every strategy**: last two lines are `Worktree: <name|primary>` then `Session: <label>`, taken from the `AGENT IDENTITY:` context line the hook injects (§4.5); `unknown` when nothing resolves. Provenance, not attribution (Rule #3) — and never `Claude-Session:` or any harness-branded key. Label rule + per-harness resolution: `/git-flow-master`.
- **Push policy = Critical Rule #5**: resolve `git_strategy.policy.direct_push_to_protected`.
- Test-automation PRs use `.agents/skills/git-flow-master/references/pr-test-automation.md` (auto-loaded by `/git-flow-master` on `test/*` branches). Title format: `{type}({ISSUE-KEY}): {description}`.

---

## Git Strategy

> **Source of truth: the `git_strategy:` block in `.agents/project.yaml`.** `git-flow-master` reads it before any git/gh operation and adapts every branch / commit / push / PR / conflict-fix to the strategy declared there. NEVER define branch policy in this AGENTS.md: edit the `git_strategy:` block.
>
> `git_strategy.strategy` ships **`solo-main`**, not null. That is a DEFAULT, not a decision, and `meta.strategy_source: inherited` is what records the difference. `git-flow-master` OFFERS "Strategy Setup" when a project has filled in its `project_name` and `strategy_source` is still `inherited` — a real project running a strategy nobody chose. `.agents/project.yaml` is frozen by `bun run up` (updater `bootstrapOnlyPaths`), so every project keeps its own. Downstream test-automation projects typically choose `sdet` (chained suites; see `.agents/skills/git-flow-master/references/sdet-integration-trunk.md`).

This repository (a consumer of the agentic-qa-boilerplate template, scaffolded to QA-test the Bunkai product) runs `solo-main`: single maintainer, commit and push directly to `main`. `meta.strategy_source` is `inherited`, not `chosen` — Strategy Setup's Q4 (push policy) was answered at some point (`policy.*` is filled with real values), but the questionnaire never formally stamped the strategy itself as chosen. Per `git-flow-master`'s bootstrap trigger, this qualifies for an OFFER of Strategy Setup on the next git intent (`project.project_name` is set, `strategy_source` is still `inherited`) — offer it, don't auto-run it.

### Accepted divergence — declared policy vs enforced ruleset

**None declared in this repo** (`git_strategy.policy.accepted_divergences` is empty). If `verify` ever reports drift again, declare it there, per `.agents/skills/git-flow-master/references/ruleset-parity.md` §2b.


`bun run git:policy verify` reported **zero drift** at the last stamp ("no ruleset rules apply" to `main` on the host): `meta.policy_verified` holds the date, `meta.policy_source: verified`.

This is a change from an earlier state of this repo (last checked 2026-08-20/21) where a `ProtectPublic` ruleset requiring a pull request on `main` was active and bypassed by the admin push credential. That ruleset no longer applies here as of the 2026-08-23 check — either it was removed from this repo or its scope changed. If a future `bun run git:policy verify` reports drift again (declared `allowed` vs. enforced `blocked`), that is the old situation resurfacing, not a new bug: the fix then is the same as it was — record it in `git_strategy.policy.accepted_divergences` (`.agents/project.yaml`), never silently "correct" the yaml to `confirm`, and never run `bun run git:policy apply` while `direct_push_to_protected: allowed` is intentional (it would derive a ruleset with no `pull_request` rule, stripping the requirement for non-bypass contributors).

Why `direct_push_to_protected` stays `allowed` regardless of host ruleset state: this repo has exactly one maintainer with admin credentials, and `allowed` describes how work actually lands here — it is the value `git-flow-master` reads before deciding whether to ask permission for each push (Critical Rule #5). Re-run `bun run git:policy verify` at the start of any session that will push, rather than trusting this paragraph's staleness.

## 12. PROACTIVE MEMORY TRIGGERS

Engram MCP configured. Call `mem_save` IMMEDIATELY (no user prompt needed) after ANY of:

- **Architecture / design decision made** (tradeoffs chosen, alternative rejected).
- **Convention or workflow established** (naming, structure, branch policy).
- **Bug fix completed**: include root cause, not just fix.
- **Non-obvious discovery, gotcha, or edge case** found.
- **Session close**: MANDATORY `mem_session_summary` before saying "done" / "listo".

Self-check after every task: *did I make decision, fix bug, learn something non-obvious, or establish convention? If yes → `mem_save` NOW.*

---

*AI persistent memory. Update when behaviors / skills / rules change.*

## Project Assessment (Phase 1)

Assessment Date: 2026-08-19

### Testing Maturity: 2/4
- Current state: Moderate (unit + substantial integration-style tests, no automated E2E, and no gate actually runs the suite)
- Test files: 145 (`*.test.ts`, target repo, excluding `node_modules`)
- Frameworks: `bun:test` only (built-in runner via `@types/bun`; no Jest/Vitest/Playwright in devDependencies, no `playwright.config.*`/`vitest.config.*`/`jest.config.*` found)
- Coverage: unknown (no coverage tool/report configured; `package.json` has no `test:coverage` script)
- Evidence: tests span `lib/**` (validation, isolation, RLS-parity, RPC) and `app/api/v1/**` (route handlers) plus `middleware.test.ts` and `scripts/sync-jira-issues.test.ts`. Several suites (e.g. `lib/api/rls-parity.test.ts`) hit a real Supabase instance via env-gated `describe.skip`, which is integration-grade coverage of cross-tenant RLS behavior — stronger than pure unit tests. No browser/E2E automation exists (no Playwright, no `e2e/` runner config; directories literally named `tests/` under `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` hold `.test.ts` files, not an E2E harness).
- Critical gap: neither `.husky/pre-commit` nor `.husky/pre-push` runs `bun test` (pre-commit runs `lint-staged` + `types:check` + `vars:check` + `skills:check`; pre-push runs `format:check` + `lint:check` + `vars:env:check` + `skills:registry:check`). `test` exists only as a standalone `bun run test` script and is not wired into `repo:check`/`repo:fix` either. A large, well-designed test suite has no automated trigger.

### Documentation State: Complete
- README: yes (`README.md`, 37KB — project overview, quickstart, prerequisites)
- API docs: yes — `app/qa/qa-config.ts` documents API response shapes inline; `docs/mcp/`, `docs/setup/jira-setup-guide.md`, OpenAPI sync pipeline (`bun run api:sync`, `openapi:gen`/`openapi:diff` scripts) generate schema-level API docs
- Architecture: yes — `CONTEXT.md` (28KB, context-engineering + directory structure), `DESIGN.md` (12KB, design system/tokens), `docs/architectures/README.md`, `docs/methodology/*` (4 methodology docs), `docs/agentic-development-engineering.md`
- Setup guide: yes — `INSTALLER.md` (32KB, installer contract), `docs/setup/README.md`, `docs/workflows/*` (git-flow, environments, sync-openapi)
- Note: no standalone `CONTRIBUTING.md` found at root; contribution conventions live inside `CLAUDE.md` (55KB) instead.

### Code Quality
- [x] ESLint: configured — `eslint.config.js` (flat config) extends `@antfu/eslint-config` + `@next/eslint-plugin-next`, `lessOpinionated: true`, with targeted overrides (`ts/no-explicit-any: warn`, `no-console: off` for test logging). Reasonably strict, not maximal.
- [x] Prettier: configured — `.prettierrc` (semi, singleQuote, printWidth 100, trailingComma es5), scoped to `json/yml/yaml/css/scss/html` (TS/TSX formatting delegated to ESLint via `@antfu/eslint-config`, not Prettier).
- [x] TypeScript: strict — `tsconfig.json` has `"strict": true`, plus `isolatedModules`, `esModuleInterop`, path aliases (`@/*`, `@app/*`, `@components/*`, `@lib/*`).
- [x] Pre-commit hooks: configured — `.husky/pre-commit` runs `lint-staged` (ESLint --fix on staged TS/JS, Prettier --write on staged json/yml/css/html) + full-repo `types:check` + `vars:check` + `skills:check`, with a conditional `skills:registry:check` gate when skill files are staged. `.husky/pre-push` adds full-repo `format:check` + `lint:check` + `vars:env:check` + `skills:registry:check`. Neither hook runs `bun test` (see Testing Maturity gap above).

### CI/CD Maturity: None
- No `.github/workflows/` in target repo (confirmed via directory listing — `.github` does not exist at root). Deploys via Vercel Git integration only (per `.context/project-config.md`: no `vercel.json`, zero-config deploy, `main` → production, `staging` → Vercel staging environment). Quality gates that exist (`repo:check`, `bun test`) run only locally/manually and via Husky git hooks — nothing runs them on push/PR/merge at the platform level.

### Secret Leak Sweep
- Grepped `app/`, `lib/`, `middleware.ts` for `(api[_-]?key|secret|password|token)\s*[:=]\s*['"]` and for literal secret-shaped strings (`sk_live`, `sk_test`, AWS `AKIA...`, JWT-shaped `eyJ...eyJ`).
- All hits were false positives, no literal secret values found:
  - `app/design-tokens/page.tsx` (design-token CSS block) — CSS design-token hex color values (`--bg-0`, `--accent`, etc.), not credentials.
  - `app/qa/qa-config.ts` (API response-shape doc strings) — documentation strings describing an API response shape (`token:"bk_pat_<prefix>.<secret>"`), placeholder text, not a literal value.
  - `app/qa/qa-config.ts` (DBHub config template) — `password = "${DBHUB_PASSWORD}"`, an env-var interpolation placeholder in a config template, not a hardcoded credential.
- No matches for literal secret-shaped strings anywhere in `app/`, `lib/`, `cli/`, `scripts/`.

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| No CI/CD — no `.github/workflows/`, so nothing runs lint/types/tests automatically on push or PR | HIGH | Add a GitHub Actions workflow running `bun run repo:check` and `bun test` on every PR and push to `main`, blocking merge on failure |
| 145 test files exist but are not wired into any automated gate — neither `.husky/pre-commit` nor `.husky/pre-push` runs `bun test`, and CI does not exist to run it either | HIGH | Add `bun test` to CI (see above) at minimum; consider adding it to `.husky/pre-push` for local enforcement, mirroring how `format:check`/`lint:check` are already handled there |
| Single Supabase project shared across local/staging/production (no environment/data isolation), per `.context/project-config.md` line 27-41 | HIGH | Provision separate Supabase projects per environment (or at minimum enforce isolated schemas/seed data for test runs) before running automated regression suites against staging, to avoid corrupting shared data |
| No ORM (direct `@supabase/supabase-js` client + `.rpc()` calls) — manual SQL-adjacent surface | MEDIUM | Injection risk is mitigated in practice: sampled usage (`lib/supabase/rpc.ts`) shows only parameterized `.rpc()` calls with named args, no raw string-concatenated SQL found. Keep `bun run types:gen` (Supabase type generation) current and add a CI drift-check so hand-maintained types don't silently diverge from schema |
| No E2E/browser automation — no Playwright, no `e2e/` harness, despite this being the standard tool for the QA boilerplate's KATA stack | MEDIUM | Once `/adapt-framework` runs, wire Playwright E2E coverage for critical user flows (auth, ATC creation, run reporting) to complement the existing unit/integration `bun:test` suite |
| No automated secret-scanning tool in CI/pre-commit (manual sweep in this assessment found nothing, but that was a one-time check) | LOW | Add a lightweight secret-scan step (e.g. gitleaks) to the future CI workflow as defense-in-depth |

### Phase Prioritization

- Phase 1: Normal -- discovery is complete; `.context/project-config.md` already captures stack, architecture, and deploy model clearly, and this assessment found no surprises requiring rework.
- Phase 2 (PRD/SRS): Extended -- the CI/CD gap and shared-Supabase-across-environments risk are significant enough that the SRS needs explicit NFR sections on release safety, environment isolation, and test-gating before automation work begins.
- Phase 3 (Infrastructure): Skip -- already substantially covered by `.context/project-config.md` (environment URLs, DB access path via DBHub, deploy model); only unverified item is live staging reachability, not worth a dedicated phase.
- Phase 4 (Specification/PBI): Normal -- test file comments already reference existing Jira ticket keys (e.g. `BK-87`, `BK-255`, `BK-49`), indicating an active Jira backlog to sync against via the standard PBI pull, no extended discovery needed.

### Blockers
- [ ] None

## Phase 2 Progress - PRD

- [x] `.context/PRD/executive-summary.md` — Problem Statement, Solution Overview (5 core capabilities), Success Metrics (mostly Inferred/Unknown — no analytics/monitoring tooling found), Target Users, Product Scope, Discovery Gaps, QA Relevance, Document References.
- [x] `.context/PRD/user-personas.md` — 4 personas (`owner`/`admin`/`member`/`viewer`, the full `MemberRole` enum), Role Hierarchy Mermaid backed by code-verified `ROLE_RANK` (`lib/workspaces/invites.ts`, `ROLE_RANK`), Permission Matrix, Test Account Requirements flagged as a gap (no per-role env vars in either repo's `.env.example`).
- [x] `.context/PRD/user-journeys.md` — Route Map (Public/Protected/Dynamic), 5 journeys (Onboarding, Story→ATC authoring, Test→Run execution, Bug filing from a failed step, Invite→Accept), Navigation Structure, Breadcrumb Patterns, Critical Paths, Discovery Gaps, QA Relevance.
- [ ] `.context/business/business-feature-map.md` — deferred to the standalone `/business-feature-map` command, not produced in this phase (per `phase-2-prd.md` §4).

## Business Data Map
