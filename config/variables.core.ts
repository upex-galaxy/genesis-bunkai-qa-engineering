/**
 * KATA Architecture — SYNCED CORE of the variables module.
 *
 * `bun run up` OVERWRITES this file. The project's own half is
 * `config/variables.ts`, which imports from here and is never overwritten.
 *
 * WHY THE SPLIT EXISTS. `config/variables.ts` is on the updater's protected
 * watchlist because every project adapts its environments, its URLs and its
 * credential map — correctly so. But the same file also resolved the Atlassian
 * host used by `config.tms.jira.url`, which the Jira-Direct TMS provider writes
 * test results back onto. An adapted copy therefore stopped receiving resolver
 * fixes in the one failure class AGENTS.md §7 singles out: a stale host does
 * not raise an error, it writes to the wrong site in silence.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE. Everything with no project knowledge in it: the `.env`
 * bootstrap, the instance-resolver wiring, generic environment detection, and
 * the TMS / browser / reporting blocks, which are read by synced code
 * (`tests/utils/jiraSync.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `ApiBase`) and describe
 * the framework rather than the product under test.
 *
 * WHAT DOES NOT. The environment names, the URL map, the credential map and
 * the auth endpoints. Those are the project's, and moving them into a file
 * that gets overwritten would be strictly worse than not splitting at all.
