## 1 · Install the binary and confirm the runtime

```bash
command -v orca                                  # the binary
orca status --json </dev/null | jq '.result.runtime'
#   want: state "ready", reachable true; note appVersion — the gotcha table is keyed to it
orca open --json </dev/null                      # if the runtime is not reachable
```

The gate this repo uses is `binary + reachable runtime`, never "is a vendor skill installed"
(`SKILL.md` §The gate). A machine with the binary and no stubs is fully capable.

**Gotcha (Linux)**: outside an Orca-managed terminal the CLI registers as `orca-ide`, because
`/usr/bin/orca` is the GNOME Orca screen reader. Run the gate with `command -v orca-ide` there
and use `orca-ide` for every later command; inside Orca's own terminals `orca` is correct.

Install instructions come from the vendor, not from here — this repo's installer lists the binary as
an OPTIONAL external CLI and reports its absence without ever failing
(`cli/install.ts`, the external-CLI table).

---

## 2 · Vendor skill stubs (optional)

```bash
orca skills list                                 # the bundled guide topics
orca skills install --skill orchestration --skill orca-cli --agent universal
orca skills installed
```

These are **optional and never required**. The stubs teach WHEN, not HOW; the grammar is served by
the binary on demand (`orca skills get <topic>`), which is what this repo's references ask for on the DEEP topics; the stubs themselves are loaded, not fetched (AGENTS.md §5).
Install them if you want the user-level trigger words; skip them and nothing breaks.

Note `orca skills install --local` installs into the current project instead of globally. In THIS
repo, do not use `--local`: a stub landing inside the project skill store would show up as an
untracked skill directory and collide with the repo's own tier model. Global (the default) or
`--agent universal`, and nothing else.

## 3 · The two native-launch prerequisites

These two items decide whether **supervision** is available on this machine at all, so they are not
optional extras. The native launch (`worker-start --agent <agent> --model <id> --effort <level>`) is
the ONLY supervised one: the runtime recognizes only agents it started itself, so a terminal created
from our own command line can never be adopted (`references/gotchas.md` G44). A machine that has not
done both items below can still run a fleet, but every worker on it is unsupervised.

### 3.1 · The agent's default arguments (permission mode)

The native path accepts a model and an effort level and **nothing else**: there is no argument
passthrough on `worker-start` or on `worktree create`, so a permission mode cannot be expressed as a
flag. It has to be a per-agent default configured in the app:

1. Open the app's Settings → the Agents section.
2. For the `claude` agent, add `--permission-mode auto` to its default arguments.
3. Leave the run mode per-agent: an agent with its own argument override is excluded from the global
   yolo / manual switch, which is what you want — you do not want a global switch deciding a worker's
   permission model.

Two things to know before relying on it:

- The app's own "yolo" mode injects a FIXED flag per agent, and it is NOT an auto permission mode:
  for `claude` it is the skip-permissions flag, for `codex` the bypass-approvals-and-sandbox flag.
  Those are broader than what a worker needs. The auto-mode classifier belongs to Claude Code, not
  to the runtime, and that classifier is the thing worth keeping alive (gotcha G27).
- For any agent other than `claude`, **consult that agent's own documentation** for its equivalent.
  OpenCode exposes `--auto` (auto-approve permissions not explicitly denied); confirm it with
  `opencode --help` on the machine. For Codex, do not guess a flag — read its docs, then write the
  verified value here.
- **(unverified)** the exact label of the settings section and the field, which may differ per app
  version. Read the screen, do not trust this sentence.

Until that override exists on a machine, a native worker launches in whatever mode the app's
per-agent default gives it, which is the trap gotcha G27 describes. Neither the repo nor a teammate's
machine can tell whether you did it, which is the whole problem with a non-versionable setting.

### 3.2 · Credentials for a supervised worker: the harness surfaces, and direnv only for Codex

A launch line can export variables; the native launch cannot, because it has no argv. That used to
make direnv the only seam. It no longer is: `bun run harness:env` derives from `.env` a per-harness
credential surface that a worker reads with NO shell involved.

- **Claude Code workers** read the `env` block of `.claude/settings.local.json`. On macOS/Linux the
  file is resolved from the MAIN checkout's root, so every worktree inherits it with no action
  (measured, G45 and ADR-0006: a session launched inside a worktree gave its MCP child the main
  checkout's value; the worktree's own copy was ignored. Re-verify after a harness upgrade).
- **OpenCode workers** read `.auth/opencode/<VAR>` through `{file:}` references in `opencode.jsonc`,
  relative to the worktree. `bun run worktree:provision` copies `.auth/` from the primary (mode
  `0600`), and `bun install` creates empty placeholders on a fresh clone so the config still loads.
- **Codex workers** are the only ones still on the shell: `.codex/config.toml` NAMES variables and
  reads them from the process environment at connect time. So does anything inside a worker that
  reads a shell-exported variable (`acli`, `curl`, `bun xray`). For those, direnv in Orca's
  **interactive shell** is the seam: with it installed and hooked, an `.envrc` that sources the repo's
  env file fires when the worker's terminal opens. Measured (G45): a direct probe showed
  `direnv: export +ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN +ATLASSIAN_EMAIL …` and then the probe variable reading `SET`.

Without direnv, a Codex worker (or a shell-exported CLI inside any worker) has NO credentials **and
nothing reports it**. It fails much later, at its first authenticated call, with an error that reads
like a broken tool (gotcha G45).

```bash
bun run harness:env                              # after every .env change; then restart the agent session
command -v direnv                                # Codex workers / shell-exported vars only: installed AND hooked
cat .envrc                                       # must source the repo's env file; never commit secrets here
direnv allow                                     # once per checkout, per machine
```

`bun run worktree:provision` runs `direnv allow <worktree>` for you, but only when direnv is
installed AND the primary checkout's `.envrc` is already allowed, and it prints what it did (or why it
skipped). It never approves an `.envrc` on a machine that never approved the primary.

Two rules that follow from this being per-machine and invisible:

- The conductor **verifies credentials on the worker's screen** before sending it any work
  (`references/coordinator-playbook.md` §1 step 5), whichever surface they came from. Readiness is
  not capability.
- `.envrc` is a per-machine convenience, not a repo contract. Nothing in this repo may depend on it
  existing: the custom-argv line loads the env file through the repo's own wrapper instead, and that
  is why the human-paste path needs none of this.

---

## 4 · The setup hook → the provisioning script

```bash
orca repo list --json </dev/null
orca repo show --repo <selector> --json </dev/null     # read the CURRENT setup command + policy
```

Read the registered setup command (`orca repo show`, above): if it only installs dependencies, it
covers one row of the gap table in `references/provisioning.md` §1. Point it at
`bun run worktree:provision` instead and every repairable row closes automatically:

- In the app: the repository's settings → the setup script field → `bun run worktree:provision`.
- Keep the setup policy at run-by-default, so a newly created worktree provisions itself before the
  agent starts.

**This setting is UI-only** (gotcha G24): the CLI does not expose it, the machine-readable command
schema has no command for it, and desktop automation is blocked by the OS permission model on
macOS. It cannot be scripted and it cannot be versioned.

---

## 5 · Mobile pairing (optional)

Pairing a phone is what makes "send me the summary on my phone" real: the board card, its comment
and shared artifacts become readable away from the desk, and a blocking question can be answered
from there. The pairing flow lives in the app plus the environment commands
(`orca environment list` / `orca environment add --pairing-code <code>`); the pairing code itself is
issued by the app. Which controls the phone offers over a blocking question is **(unverified)** —
find out during a real fleet, and record it in `references/gotchas.md`.

---

## 6 · The checklist, to copy

```
[ ] binary installed, `orca status` reports a reachable runtime; appVersion noted
[ ] (optional) vendor stubs installed GLOBALLY, never --local in this repo
[ ] Settings -> Agents: `claude` default args include `--permission-mode auto`
    (prerequisite of the SUPERVISED native launch; a pasted custom-argv line needs nothing)
[ ] other agents: their documented equivalent, verified, not guessed
[ ] `bun run harness:env` run after the last `.env` change (Claude and OpenCode workers read the
    generated surfaces; no direnv needed for them)
[ ] direnv installed, hooked into the shell, `.envrc` sources the env file, `direnv allow` run
    (Codex workers and shell-exported CLI vars only; verify on the worker's screen at launch)
[ ] repo setup script set to `bun run worktree:provision`, policy run-by-default
[ ] (optional) phone paired
[ ] a single test worker launched and released end to end BEFORE a real fleet
```

The last line is not decoration. A machine where nobody has ever released a worker is a machine
where the cleanup path is untested, and the cleanup path is the one that takes the runtime down when
it is wrong (gotcha G31).
