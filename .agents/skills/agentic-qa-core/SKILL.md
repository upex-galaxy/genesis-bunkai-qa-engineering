# Agentic QA Core — Foundation reference host

`agentic-qa-core` is the shared reference library that every workflow skill in this repo cites. It exists so doctrine (briefing template, dispatch patterns, orchestration rules, skill composition tiers) lives in one place instead of being duplicated across every `SKILL.md`.

Loading a workflow skill (e.g. `shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-automation`) implies loading the relevant `agentic-qa-core/references/*.md` on demand — workflow skills declare a `## Dependencies` block at the top so the AI knows what to pull in.

This skill does NOT orchestrate workflows, does NOT generate files, and does NOT bootstrap a target repo. The entire framework (skills, foundation files, scripts) ships together as one repo; à la carte adoption is not supported — see "Install model" below.

## Compact Rules

<!--
  This section is Strategy A for scripts/build-skill-registry.ts, and it is
  load-bearing for CORRECTNESS, not just for quality. Without it the builder
  fell through to Strategy B, which scrapes bare bullets and cannot see the
  `agentic-qa-core does not:` sentence that governs the "Out of scope" list —
  so every prohibition below shipped into REGISTRY.md as a PERMISSION, and from
  there into subagent briefings that AGENTS.md §3 labels authoritative.
  Keep each rule self-contained: a rule that needs a preceding sentence to mean
  what it says is a rule that will eventually be extracted without it.
-->

- DO NOT create, modify, or delete ANY file while acting as `agentic-qa-core`. It is a passive reference library with no write path of its own.
- DO NOT write `.context/` artifacts here (that is `/project-discovery`), scaffold tests / fixtures / KATA components (that is `/adapt-framework` and `/test-automation`), adapt the framework to a stack (`/adapt-framework`), sync AI-critical docs (`/sync-ai-context`), or sync OpenAPI schemas (`bun run api:sync`).
- DO NOT orchestrate a workflow or bootstrap a target repo from this skill. It hosts doctrine; the workflow skills execute it.
- WHEN a workflow skill cites `agentic-qa-core/references/*.md`: load ONLY the files that skill's `## Dependencies` block names. Never preload the whole reference set.
- WHEN deriving test cases or coverage from acceptance criteria in ANY testing skill: `references/test-design-doctrine.md` is mandatory reading first.
- WHEN filing any bug / defect / improvement: `references/defect-management-doctrine.md` is mandatory reading first.
- WHEN dispatching a subagent: use the 7-component briefing in `references/briefing-template.md` and pick the pattern via `references/dispatch-patterns.md`. A subagent that must answer the user directly also loads `references/behavioral-layer.md` — it inherits no register from the orchestrator.
- WHEN closing a workflow stage: verify that stage's Definition of Done in `references/stage-gates.md` BEFORE advancing.
- DO edit the owning skill's `references/*.md` when a rule changes, then run `bun run skills:registry`, then refresh the deck under `packages/decks/agentic-qa-core/`. That order keeps prose, registry, and decks from drifting.
- DO treat this boilerplate as clone-in-full. Copying a single skill directory in isolation leaves it without the foundation files it depends on, and it will not function.

## References hosted

| File | Cited by | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `references/test-design-doctrine.md` | `shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation` | **Canonical doctrine for deriving test cases / ATCs from acceptance criteria**: the 5 principles (AC-verify ≠ testing; AC = floor not ceiling; criterion-vs-test-case; 1:N explode-default/justify-collapse; risk-outside-criterion), the redefined coverage model, and the formal techniques (EP, BVA, State-Transition, Decision Tables, Pairwise, Error Guessing, Risk-based) with binding triggers + the Test-Design Checklist gate. |
| `references/briefing-template.md` | `shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation`, `regression-testing`, `project-discovery` | The 7-component subagent briefing template, with concrete filled examples per dispatch pattern. |
| `references/dispatch-patterns.md` | All workflow skills with a "Subagent Dispatch Strategy" section | Decision table + heuristic for picking Single / Sequential / Parallel / Background. |
| `references/stage-gates.md` | All workflow skills (`shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation`, `regression-testing`) | Definition-of-Done checklist per workflow stage. The orchestrator verifies each stage's DoD (planning stages include the Test-Design Checklist) before appending the progress checkpoint and advancing — turns the prose doctrine into an enforced gate. |
| `references/orchestration-doctrine.md` | Subagents that need orchestration rules without pulling the whole `AGENTS.md` | Cacheable mirror of `AGENTS.md` §"Orchestration Mode (Subagent Strategy)". |
| `references/behavioral-layer.md` | Subagents that must answer the user directly, in any workflow skill | Cacheable mirror of `AGENTS.md` §2: caveman compression, Butler granularity, PM Voice register, Visual Mapping. A dispatched subagent inherits none of that from the orchestrator, so its report reads in a different voice unless it pulls this. |
| `references/skill-composition-strategy.md` | `framework-development`, every workflow skill | T1-T4 tier model + SDD boundary + composition contract. |
| `references/skill-resolver.md` | Skills that resolve composable skills at runtime via the registry | Skill Resolver Protocol used by sub-agent launches. Companion: `scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → `.agents/skills/REGISTRY.md`. |
| `references/preflight-gate.md` | `shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation`, `regression-testing`, `framework-development` | Readiness Preflight Gate doctrine — probe tools/MCPs/CLIs/credentials and surface a user checklist BEFORE a skill starts its real work. Owns the secret/token handling + OpenAPI `api-login` → RESTART flow. |
| `references/mcp-capabilities.md` | `AGENTS.md` Rule #10 / §5 / §6, `preflight-gate.md` §8, every skill declaring `metadata.requires_capabilities` | The MCP capability vocabulary (`web-search`, `library-docs`, `db`, `api-schema`, `browser`): tool-name suffixes that provide each one (a prefix is a server, a suffix is the capability, so a claude.ai connector or a user-level server qualifies), the committed `.mcp.json` server, how to enable a missing one per host, the frontmatter declaration + correspondence rule, and the point-of-use STOP (never a silent fallback). Mirrored by the `CAPABILITY-VOCAB` and `CAPABILITY-UNDECLARED` checks in `scripts/lint-skills.ts`. |
| `references/adr-doctrine.md` | `project-discovery`, `framework-development`, `sprint-testing`, `test-automation` | When a test-architecture decision earns an ADR (two-gate test: architectural AND hard-to-reverse) + the detect → draft → record procedure. Test architecture = runner/framework choice, Page-Object vs Screenplay, fixture/data strategy, isolation & parallelization, auth-in-tests, selector contract, exploratory-vs-scripted boundary, reporting/CI sharding, flake-retry policy. |
| `references/api-testing-doctrine.md` | `sprint-testing`, `test-automation`, `test-documentation` | **Canonical API-testing maneuver** (agentic level, not KATA code): the three-tool split — OpenAPI MCP = schema READ-ONLY (discover endpoints/schemas), `bun run api:login` = mint token only (→ `.auth/tokens.env` env var `API_TOKEN_<ROLE>_<ENV>` + `.auth/tokens.json` keyed `<ROLE>_<ENV>`; `--profile <name>` isolates both under `.auth/profiles/<name>/`), curl = authenticated execution. Covers the schema-drift caveat (dev/latest vs target env), token-freshness checks, and the "shell env vars don't persist across the agent's Bash calls → `source` per curl call" rule. |
| `references/db-testing-doctrine.md` | `sprint-testing` (trifuerza DB leg), `test-automation` | **Canonical DB-testing maneuver**, sibling of the API one: DBHub MCP as `[DB_TOOL]` (tools named `{tool}_{source_id}`, so `execute_sql_primary` / `search_objects_primary`), `dbhub.toml` interpolating `${DBHUB_*}` from the launch environment, the `DBHUB_*` vars `.env.example` declares, the validation query cookbook (orphans, duplicates, numeric mismatch, timestamp windows, four strategies, checklist) and connection troubleshooting. |
| `references/mcp-atlassian-optin.md` | `acli`, `agentic-qa-onboard`, anyone enabling MCP-level Jira access or debugging `agents:compat:check` | The opt-in Atlassian MCP block for Claude / OpenCode / Codex (literal `JIRA_URL` from `bun run --silent jira:url`, `{file:}` secrets on OpenCode, `env_vars` on Codex) and the MCP parity contract (what the check compares and why Codex never gets a placeholder). |
| `references/planning-ladder.md` | `sprint-testing`, `regression-testing`, `project-context`, `test-documentation`, the sync scripts | The ratified QA Planning Ladder: altitudes (MTP / FTP / STP / ATP / RTP and their Runs), the `{ACRONYM}: {scope}: {desc}` title grammar, the four QA-process Epics, items-over-fields, with the RTP/RTR amendments. |
| `references/defect-management-doctrine.md` | `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation`, `regression-testing` | **Canonical doctrine for filing and owning quality issues**: Bug / Defect / Improvement classified by the FEATURE's lifecycle stage (not by where it was found), QA Assignee self-set and never overwritten, mandatory Components, the three-axis model (parent = QA process epic, link = source Story, components = product module), the mandatory field matrix and the Severity → Priority derivation. |
| `references/traceability-linking.md` | `shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `regression-testing` | Turning declared traceability into real Jira issue links — Story ↔ test-artifact coverage, Story → Bug causation, Story → Bug blocking, the `TC → ATS → Story` cascade, and the post-create verification recipe. Local declarations document intent; these links are what a consumer walking `issuelinks` actually reads. |
| `references/session-management.md` | Every long/medium workflow skill (Phase 0 resume check, Phase N archive) | The long-skill resume contract: plan-first persistence under `.session/<skill-slug>/<scope>/`, the per-stage progress checkpoint, resume detection after an interruption, and the topic-key conventions for artifact tagging. |
| `references/session-footer-contract.md` | Every skill explicitly marked in its metadata as the owner of a stage (`metadata.stage_owner: true`) | The chat-facing close-out contract: the two blocks the AI surfaces unprompted at session end (captured evidence paths; skills / MCPs / CLIs used + testing-pyramid levels touched, "none" stated per untouched level). Chat only — never a Jira comment or ATR body. |
| `references/evidence-conventions.md` | `sprint-testing`, `bug-screenshot-annotation`, `regression-testing`, and any subagent briefed to capture evidence | The shared three-bucket model for every file produced while testing, plus the naming contract. Prevents the two recurring failures: stray artifacts at the repo root, and "evidence" claimed in a report that never existed on disk. |
| `references/acli-integration.md` | Every skill that resolves `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` / `[TMS_TOOL]` to `/acli` | The QA-side plug for the tool-agnostic `acli` skill: which slug, which status, which custom field, which modality. Load it BEFORE the tool surface — `acli/SKILL.md` answers *how the binary works*, this answers *what to send it here*. |
| `references/jira-publishing-gotchas.md` | Any skill about to publish to a Jira rich-text field (Story / Bug / Test body or custom field) | The Markdown → ADF conversion edges that produce an HTTP 400 at publish time, and how to pre-empt them. Scope boundary: this is what BREAKS; `acli/references/adf-authoring-style.md` is what reads well. |
| `references/skill-refinement-protocol.md` | Every skill marked `metadata.stage_owner: true` in its frontmatter (session close), `skill-scaffold.md` | How a session PROPOSES a lesson for a skill instead of editing it: the four criteria (stable, not regenerable, changes behaviour, paid for), the `refinements.md` block schema, the apply matrix per skill owner, and the human gate per entry. |
| `references/skill-scaffold.md` | `framework-development` (the change IS a skill), `project-context` mode `context-skill` | The contract every new T1 skill is born with: frontmatter incl. `metadata.kind`, per-kind files + suffix + mandatory sections, the three-question test for context skills (`.context/` holds facts, the skill holds judgment, cite never copy), the minimal context-skill template and the Definition of Done. |
| `references/upstream-feedback.md` | Every skill marked `metadata.stage_owner: true` in its frontmatter (failure / blocker path), `skill-refinement-protocol.md` §4 | Filing a skill problem against the boilerplate: repo resolution order (`UPEX_TEMPLATE_REPO` → installer lock → local), the redacted draft, explicit OK before `gh issue create`, verification with `gh issue view`, the manual-filing fallback. |
| `references/artifact-lifecycle.md` | `shift-left-testing`, `sprint-testing`, `test-documentation`, `test-automation`, `regression-testing` | Which status every harness artifact is created in, which stage moves it where via which transition slug, and its terminal status. Covers assignee-at-create on every QA artifact, the unmapped-status fallback (list the live transitions, one question, fire the live id, recommend `bun run jira:sync-workflows`) and the light stage verifier every stage closes with. Load before firing any transition. |
| `references/decision-elicitation-doctrine.md` | `agentic-qa-onboard`, any skill that must ask the user to decide | How the harness asks a human to decide: the ladder from harness prompt to `mkd` decision deck to plan mode, the threshold (more than three decisions, or one dense one), the non-silent gate and its fallback, and how to read the returned contract (a "did not understand" note means do not execute that item). |
| `references/volatile-facts.md` | Every skill that writes or reviews committed prose (`framework-development`, `sync-ai-context`, `project-context`, `pr-review-lead`), `AGENTS.md` Rule #17, the two linters | **Canon for Critical Rule #17**: committed prose names the source of truth, never its current value. The five volatile categories (count, enumeration, `file:line`, current-state claim, edit-history narration) with one test each, the stable vocabulary that passes, the exemptions where a snapshot is the point, the forensic-note split (the why stays, the figure and date go to ADR-0006 or a dated ledger), and the `volatile-ok: <reason>` escape hatch the `FILE-LINE` / `CURRENT-STATE` lint checks honour. |

When a skill cites one of these, it includes a Dependencies block at the top so the AI knows to load `agentic-qa-core` before continuing.

## Core reference decks (visual, human-facing)

`agentic-qa-core` hosts the canonical presentations below under `packages/decks/agentic-qa-core/` (published on the GitHub Pages hub; see `agentic-qa-onboard` for the opening protocol):

| File | Teaches | Language |
|------|---------|----------|
| `naming-conventions.es.html` | The Naming Codex — every test-artifact title format across the seven layers (CASE · GROUP · CONTAINER · CODE · JIRA · GIT · FILESYSTEM), plus a coverage audit of open naming gaps. | Spanish (technical terms in English) |
| `skills-io-flow.es.html` | The E2E flow (Historia → Refinamiento → Dev → Testing) seen through each skill's **inputs & outputs** — what every phase reads (stdin), which skills it loads (deps), what it produces (stdout), and which Jira fields/transitions it touches. Mac-terminal UI with one tab per phase. | Spanish (technical terms in English) |
| `output-style.es.html` | The chat-output contract the AI speaks under — the layer split (caveman compression / Butler granularity / PM Voice register / Visual Mapping form), what each layer owns, and the suspension triggers that switch the register to technical. | Spanish (technical terms in English) |

They are the human-facing mirror of the rules that live in prose across the workflow skills' `references/*.md`. The Naming Codex answers "how is this artifact named"; the skills-io deck answers "what does this skill need and emit"; the output-style deck answers "why does the AI talk like that". Navigate with arrow keys (naming deck: `O` = overview, `F` = fullscreen; skills-io deck: tabs + `1-9`). Offer the matching deck when a user asks about naming or about how the skills chain together end-to-end.

**Keep them canonical**: when a rule changes, edit the owning skill's `references/*.md`, regenerate `REGISTRY.md` (`bun run skills:registry`), then refresh the deck in `packages/decks/agentic-qa-core/` so the decks never drift from the prose source.

---

## Dependency declaration for downstream skills

Every workflow skill that cites `agentic-qa-core/references/*.md` should declare it explicitly so the AI knows what to load on demand. Example block to add near the top of the skill's `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
## Dependencies
Requires `agentic-qa-core`. Loads on demand:
- agentic-qa-core/references/briefing-template.md
- agentic-qa-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md
```

The block is documentation — the AI reads it and pulls the cited files. There is no automated wiring: skills are markdown, not code.

---

## Install model

This boilerplate is designed to be cloned in full. The workflow skills under `.agents/skills/` depend on foundation files that live at the repo root (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/`, `scripts/`, `package.json`, `tests/`) and on shared references under `agentic-qa-core/references/`. Installing only a subset of skills (e.g. copying one skill directory in isolation) leaves those skills without their dependencies and they will not function.

If a downstream user has only the skills and not the rest of the repo, the supported path is to clone the full boilerplate repository and integrate it as a single unit. No per-skill scaffolding action is provided by this skill — the skill set is intentionally inseparable from the foundation.

---

## Out of scope

`agentic-qa-core` does not:

- Create or modify any files. It is a passive reference library.
- Create or modify `.context/` files (that belongs to `/project-discovery`).
- Generate or scaffold tests, fixtures, or KATA components (that belongs to `/adapt-framework` and `/test-automation`).
- Adapt the framework to a specific stack (that belongs to `/adapt-framework`).
- Sync AI-critical documents or project-specific facts in `AGENTS.md` (that belongs to `/sync-ai-context`).
- Sync OpenAPI / API schemas (that's `bun run api:sync`).

For framework evolution (changes to KATA bases, fixtures, `cli/`, `scripts/`, `api/schemas/` pipeline), see `/framework-development`.
