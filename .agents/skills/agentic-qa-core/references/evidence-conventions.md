# Evidence Conventions (shared contract)

> Cited by: `sprint-testing` (Stage 2 capture + Stage 3 handoff), `bug-screenshot-annotation`, `regression-testing` (artifact triage), and any subagent briefed to capture or reference evidence. This file consolidates the evidence rules previously scattered across `sprint-testing/references/reporting-templates.md` (§1.11, §3.5) and `sprint-testing/references/exploration-patterns.md` (§5.3) — those sections stay authoritative for their stage mechanics and point here for the shared bucket + naming model.

Every file produced while testing falls into exactly one of three buckets. Misfiling is the root cause of two recurring failures: stray artifacts committed to the repo root, and "evidence" claimed in a report that never existed on disk.

---

## 1. The three buckets

| Bucket | What | Where it lives | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Auto-generated logs (noise)** | Console/network logs and session files auto-produced by the automation tool (`[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` / playwright-cli) via its `outputDir` | The tool's configured output dir (`.playwright/` tree, gitignored) | Not read, not committed, not referenced. Ignore. |
| **B — Real evidence** | Screenshots, traces, videos, HARs, PDFs explicitly captured to prove a TC step, a bug, or a smoke result | The ticket's PBI `evidence/` folder (gitignored): `.context/PBI/epics/EPIC-<KEY>-<slug>/stories/STORY-<KEY>-<slug>/evidence/` (or the coverable-type equivalent folder) | Referenced by ATR / bug reports / handoffs. Named per §2. |
| **C — Annotation intermediates** | Working files produced while building a marked-up bug screenshot: the cropped source PNG and the annotation HTML (see the `bug-screenshot-annotation` skill) | The session scratchpad ONLY | Disposable. NEVER moved to `evidence/`, never referenced from Jira/ATR/bug tickets. Only the final rendered annotated PNG (Bucket B) is evidence — a future session re-derives crop/HTML from the raw screenshot if ever needed. |

**Bucket B rule — explicit destination, always.** Every capture command MUST receive an explicit destination path resolving to the ticket's `evidence/` folder. Never let a capture fall back to the tool default — that writes to the repo root CWD and clutters the workspace with stray files that look like committed assets. Note the known gotcha: `outputDir` in the automation tool config does NOT apply to screenshots — pass the full path in the capture command's filename argument (see `sprint-testing/references/exploration-patterns.md` §1.1).

**Bucket A rule — hands off the shared config.** Do not repoint the automation tool's `outputDir`: it stays at the tool-owned directory it ships with (`.playwright/output`), which is what lets parallel sessions share the file. A workflow step that says "set `outputDir` to the ticket's evidence folder before capturing" is a single-session assumption and is superseded by §5. The value is **committed**, so a ticket path written there outlives the ticket: measured on a real fleet (see ADR-0006), a repo whose config still pointed at one story's evidence folder cross-contaminated the first unqualified capture of all three concurrent sessions. Find a ticket path there → fix it back to the tool-owned directory once, do not race to overwrite it.

## 2. Naming — two stage-scoped families + the annotated suffix

Both families start with the ticket key. Pick by what the file evidences:

**Family 1 — Stage 2 exploration shots** (per `exploration-patterns.md` §5.3):

```
{KEY}-smoke-{area}.png          # smoke gate
{KEY}-ac{N}-{short-desc}.png    # AC-tied scenario
{KEY}-bug-{short-desc}.png      # raw capture of a defect found mid-exploration
```

**Family 2 — Bug-report / reproduction-step attachments** (per `reporting-templates.md` §1.11):

```
{KEY}-step{NN}-{action}.{ext}   # zero-padded step number ties the file to a repro/test step
```

`{ext}` ∈ png · jpg · gif · mp4 · log · txt · pdf · har.

**Annotated bug images** extend the pattern with a dedicated suffix instead of a step/scenario slot:

```
{KEY}-BUG-{BUG-KEY}-annotated.png
```

where `{KEY}` is the ticket under test and `{BUG-KEY}` is the filed bug/defect/improvement issue key — they differ whenever the quality issue is filed as its own Jira issue (the normal case per the defect-management doctrine). The redundant `{KEY}` prefix is deliberate: the file stays traceable if it is later dragged into a Slack thread or a shared folder. Produced exclusively by the `bug-screenshot-annotation` skill. Example shape: an annotated capture for bug `UPEX-512` found while testing story `UPEX-411` is named `UPEX-411-BUG-UPEX-512-annotated.png`.

## 3. Verify-on-disk discipline

Before ANY report, handoff, or footer lists an evidence file: `ls` the `evidence/` folder and list only files that actually exist. Never claim a capture that a subagent only *said* it took — subagent reports are testimony, the filesystem is proof. This rule is load-bearing for both the Evidence Handoff (`sprint-testing/references/reporting-templates.md` §3.5) and the session footer (`session-footer-contract.md` Part 1).

---

## 4. Subagent briefing snippet (paste into component 7 — Rules)

> **Evidence rules (mandatory):** every capture command targets the ticket's `evidence/` folder with an explicit full destination path (never the tool default). Name files per `agentic-qa-core/references/evidence-conventions.md` §2. Annotation intermediates (crops, overlay HTML) go to the session scratchpad, never to `evidence/`. In your structured report, list only evidence files you verified exist on disk (`ls`), with repo-relative paths.

---

## 5. Concurrent sessions — isolate the session, never the shared config

When several sessions test different tickets at the same time on one checkout (a QA fleet, or simply two terminals), the automation tool's config file is shared and its `outputDir` is last-writer-wins: session 3 repoints it and session 1's next capture lands in session 3's ticket folder. The §1 Bucket A rule ("hands off the shared config") is what prevents that, and it is not negotiable just because a workflow step says "set `outputDir` before capturing" — that step assumes it is the only session running.

Two things are per-session, and neither one edits the shared config file:

| What | Why | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Browser profile / user-data dir** | the shipped config is non-isolated with a single user-data dir; two browsers on one profile directory collide on its lock, and the second one fails or hijacks the first one's state | give each session its own session / profile identifier |
| **Output destination** | keeps Bucket A noise and any non-explicit capture from crossing into another ticket's folder | a per-session config file, OR simply the Bucket B rule already in force: an explicit full destination on every capture |

Mechanics — the flag or environment variable the installed automation CLI reads for an alternate config, and the shape of the session identifier — belong to that tool's own skill (`/playwright-cli`): load it and use what the installed version documents. Do not invent a flag, and do not hand-edit the shared config to fake isolation.

Two constraints hold whatever the mechanism:

- An alternate config **replaces** the default, it does not merge with it, so a per-session config file must be complete.
- `outputDir` never applies to `.png`, so a screenshot passes its full destination path regardless — which is why Bucket B's explicit-destination rule already makes *evidence* concurrency-safe even with a shared config. What is left unsafe without isolation is the **browser profile**.

Every session closes its browser sessions before it reports. Orphaned browser processes accumulate per session and are a measured, non-trivial cost (see ADR-0006), not a hypothetical.
