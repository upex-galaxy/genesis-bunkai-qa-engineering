/**
 * @fileoverview Generate the per-harness credential surfaces from `.env`.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. A harness reads its config and spawns its MCP servers BEFORE any
 * hook runs. Measured on Claude Code 2.1.278, three runs out of three: the MCP
 * child is spawned 43-293 ms before `SessionStart` fires, and a variable that
 * hook injects is absent from the child's own `printenv`. So the only thing that
 * can get a credential into an MCP server is a config file the harness reads at
 * startup. Each harness reads a different one, and the `bun run claude` wrapper
 * cannot help a GUI launch or a natively-launched supervised worker, because
 * neither has a command line to wrap.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EMITS. Two surfaces, both derived from `.env`, which stays the one
 * source of truth:
 *
 *   A. `.claude/settings.local.json` -> `env` block. Read from the file at
 *      startup, so it works "no matter how `claude` was launched", it reaches
 *      the MCP child (measured), and it overwrites a stale shell export of the
 *      same name. Gitignored, already copied per worktree at mode 0600 by
 *      `scripts/provision-worktree.ts`, and on macOS/Linux read from the MAIN
 *      checkout's root so worktrees inherit it with no action.
 *
 *   B. `.auth/opencode/<VAR>` value files + `{file:...}` references in
 *      `opencode.jsonc`. OpenCode's `{env:VAR}` resolves from the process
 *      environment only, which a desktop launch does not have; `{file:path}`
 *      substitutes a file's CONTENTS and needs no environment at all.
 *
 * Codex is deliberately NOT emitted. `.codex/config.toml` is project-level and
 * overrides user config, but it is COMMITTED, so a secret cannot go in it, and
 * where its gitignored half should live is an open question. Codex stays on the
 * wrapper and is scanned here for the allowlist only.
 *
 * ALLOWLIST, NEVER THE WHOLE FILE. `.env.example` declares 24 variables and 10
 * are referenced by an MCP config. Emitting all 24 would copy a project's Jira
 * credentials and test users into a harness config that has no use for them,
 * and every copy of a secret is another place it can leak. The allowlist is
 * derived by PARSING the config files, not grepping them, so it cannot go stale
 * the way a hand-written list can: add an MCP that needs a new variable and the
 * next run finds it. Parsing also disposes of the `VAR` / `VAR_NAME` noise that
 * lives in the configs' header comments, because comments are gone before the
 * parse rather than filtered after it.
 *
 * NEVER PRINTS A VALUE. Every result in this module carries variable NAMES and
 * a match verdict. No function here returns, logs or formats a value, and the
 * comparison is done on lengths and string equality, never on printed text.

 * The root whose `.claude/settings.local.json` Claude Code actually READS.
 *
 * MEASURED on Claude Code 2.1.278 / macOS, with a scratch repo holding
 * `PROBE_ORIGIN=MAIN-CHECKOUT` in the main checkout's file and
 * `PROBE_ORIGIN=WORKTREE` in a worktree's: a session launched INSIDE the
 * worktree gave its MCP child `PROBE_ORIGIN=MAIN-CHECKOUT`. The worktree's own
 * copy was ignored.
 *
 * So emitter A has to write to the MAIN checkout even when it is invoked from a
 * worktree. Writing the worktree's copy instead is a silent no-op: the file
 * lands, the check passes, and the credential never reaches a single MCP server
 * — which is precisely the failure mode this whole mechanism exists to kill.
 * This is the inverse of the property the spec cited. "A worktree inherits the
 * main checkout's file" is true and convenient when you READ it; it is a trap
 * when you WRITE it.
 *
 * Windows is excluded because the documentation lists it among the cases where
 * the file stays beside `.claude/settings.json`, i.e. per-worktree. That is
 * doc-derived and UNVERIFIED here: there is no Windows machine on this host.
 *
 * Emitter B is deliberately NOT redirected. Its `{file:...}` paths resolve
 * relative to `opencode.jsonc`'s own directory, which IS the worktree's, so its
 * value files must stay worktree-local. The two emitters disagree about this
 * because the two harnesses resolve their paths differently.
