## Test Description

## Related Story

BK-497 — PAT | Require every API route to declare its capability posture

## Priority / ROI

- Priority: Critical
- ROI score: N/A (ROI scoring not computed this pass — verdict set directly by QA judgment; proves the one real behavioural change in this Story)
- Outcome: Candidate

## Prior bugs covered

- (none)

## Test Design

### Preconditions

- Caller holds any valid minted PAT (rejection is channel-based, not scope-based)

### Action

Send `POST /api/v1/tokens` using Bearer PAT auth.

### Expected Results (assertions of this TC — same precondition+action)

- Response status is 403
- Response message is verbatim: "Personal access tokens cannot issue tokens. Use a browser session."
- Zero rows created for the attempted token name (DB-confirmed)

### Gherkin (if Candidate)

```gherkin
@critical @regression @automation-candidate @BK-497
Scenario: should reject a PAT-authenticated POST to the token-issuance route
  Given a PAT exists with any valid scope
  When the user sends POST /api/v1/tokens using that PAT as Bearer auth
  Then the response status is 403
  And the response message is "Personal access tokens cannot issue tokens. Use a browser session."
  And no access_tokens row is created for the attempted name
```

## Architecture

API — follows KATA layers (`ApiBase` / dedicated `YourApi` component, no browser fixture).
