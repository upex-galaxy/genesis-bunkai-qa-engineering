# TEST: BK-497: TC-13: should allow session-authenticated calls to all three token routes given the cookie-only lift

**Status:** AUTOMATED
**Components:** Bunkai API Tokens

## Test Description

## Related Story

BK-497 — PAT | Require every API route to declare its capability posture

## Priority / ROI

- Priority: Critical
- Outcome: Candidate

## Prior bugs covered

- (none) if first time

## Test Design

### Preconditions

- Caller has an active staging session (cookie-authenticated, not Bearer)

### Action

The caller issues a token (`POST /api/v1/tokens`), lists tokens (`GET /api/v1/tokens`), and revokes a token (`DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}`) — all via the session cookie.

### Expected Results (assertions of this TC — same precondition+action)

- `POST /api/v1/tokens` returns 201 (issue succeeds)
- `GET /api/v1/tokens` returns 200 (list succeeds)
- `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}` returns 204 (revoke succeeds)
- All three routes behave exactly as they did before the `cookie-only` lift — session traffic is entirely unaffected by the lift

### Gherkin (if Candidate)

```gherkin
@critical @regression @automation-candidate @BK-497
Scenario: should allow session-authenticated calls to all three token routes
  Given the user has an active session (cookie-authenticated)
  When the user sends POST /api/v1/tokens using the session cookie
  Then the response status is 201
  When the user sends GET /api/v1/tokens using the session cookie
  Then the response status is 200
  When the user sends DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{issued*token*id} using the session cookie
  Then the response status is 204
```

## Variables

| Variable | How to obtain |
| --- | --- |
| `{issued*token*id}` | Captured from the `POST /api/v1/tokens` response in the same test flow |
