/**
 * lint-skills.ts — validates the T1-T4 skill tier coherence in this repo.
 *
 * Tier model (full doctrine: .agents/skills/agentic-qa-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md)
 *   T1  — project-owned skills committed under .agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md
 *   T2  — vendored upstream skills committed under .agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md
 *         (frontmatter `vendored_from` points at the upstream source)
 *   T3  — community project-level, declared in cli/install.ts:PROJECT_LEVEL_SKILLS
 *         (gitignored, fetched at install time, NOT committed)
 *   T4  — community user-level, declared in cli/install.ts:USER_LEVEL_SKILLS
 *
 * The checks below are run; each violation is printed prefixed with the relevant
 * skill or array name. Exit code 0 = pass (no ERROR violations), 1 = at least
 * one ERROR violation. WARN and INFO are reported but do not cause non-zero exit.
 *
 *   1. T1 frontmatter parseability — every directory under .agents/skills/
 *      either has SKILL.md with parseable YAML frontmatter, OR is the slug of
 *      a T3 community skill listed in PROJECT_LEVEL_SKILLS (in which case it
 *      might be present locally as a gitignored install artifact and is exempt).
 *      The `complementary_categories` field is strictly OPTIONAL — skills do
 *      not need to declare it. When declared, its values are audited by Check 4.
 *
 *   2. T3 PROJECT_LEVEL_SKILLS shape — every entry has both `package` (URL)
 *      and `skill` (string) fields.
 *
 *   3. T4 USER_LEVEL_SKILLS shape — every entry has both `package` and `skill`.
 *
 *   4. Category vocabulary — when a SKILL.md declares
 *      `complementary_categories` with at least one value, every cited
 *      category MUST be in the known-category allowlist (mirrors §5.1 of the
 *      strategy doc).
 *
 *   5. `framework-development` exclusivity — that skill MUST exist at
 *      .agents/skills/framework-development/SKILL.md AND be the only T1 with
 *      category `framework-evolution`.
 *
 *   6. Anti-leak — the substring `/sdd-` MUST NOT appear in the body of the
 *      four QA-workflow skills (sprint-testing, test-automation,
 *      regression-testing, test-documentation), EXCEPT inside the
 *      "Forbidden invocations" section which legitimately mentions it.
 *
 *   7. TIER-MISMATCH — skill named in AGENTS.md §5 but absent from
 *      cli/install.ts matching tier array, or vice versa. T1 + T4 skills
 *      exempt (T1 lives in .agents/skills/; T4 is auto-discovered at runtime).
 *      install.ts is the tier authority for community skills: one committed
 *      as a real directory inside `.agents/skills/` (downstream projects commit
 *      their `bunx skills add` output) keeps its install.ts tier and is never
 *      reclassified as T1, so the T1-only checks (frontmatter, categories,
 *      STALE-PATH, session contract) do not run over a body the project does
 *      not author. WARN severity (does not fail CI).
 *
 *   8. STALE-PATH — path-like literals in inline backtick spans of T1 SKILL.md
 *      bodies AND each skill's references/*.md (outside fenced code blocks)
 *      must resolve to existing files relative to the skill dir or repo root.
 *      Known gitignored artifacts + illustrative example paths are exempted
 *      via STALE_PATH_ALLOWED; the example components `/adapt-framework`
 *      deletes are exempted via EXAMPLE_ARTIFACTS, so a skill body that cites
 *      one passes here AND in an adapted repo. `.context/` is checked too,
 *      with a kind-scoped rule: inside a `metadata.kind: context` skill every
 *      `.context/` cite must exist (a context skill citing a dead map is the
 *      failure mode the check exists for; only the gitignored Jira cache
 *      `.context/PBI/` is exempt), while in every other skill the outputs the
 *      generators write per project (CONTEXT_GENERATED_PREFIXES: discovery,
 *      the business maps, the master test plan, skill reports) are exempt in
 *      both directions, because they do not exist in the boilerplate checkout.
 *      ERROR severity.
 *
 *   9. DUPLICATE-TIER — a skill slug appearing in more than one of
 *      PROJECT_LEVEL_SKILLS, USER_LEVEL_SKILLS is an install conflict.
 *      ERROR severity.
 *
 *  10. SESSION-BANNER-MISSING — retrofitted SKILL.md must contain the verbatim
 *      session-management banner prefix. ERROR severity.
 *
 *  11. SESSION-PHASE-0-MISSING — retrofitted SKILL.md must have a Phase 0 (or
 *      Phase -1) section that mentions `.session/`. ERROR severity.
 *
 *  12. SESSION-SCOPE-INVALID — a runtime directory under `.session/<skill>/`
 *      must match the per-skill scope regex. WARN severity (gitignored state
 *      should not break CI). No-op if `.session/` does not exist.
 *
 *  13. SKILL-HARDCODED-CFID — `customfield_NNNN` literal id inside any skill
 *      markdown outside `HARDCODED_CFID_ALLOWED_SKILLS` (tool-owner allowlist:
 *      acli + xray-cli). Anti-pattern citations exempted. ERROR severity.
 *
 *  14. SKILL-LITERAL-TOOL — literal tool commands (`acli <subcommand>`,
 *      `xray <subcommand>`, `mcp__atlassian__`, `curl …/rest/api/3/…`) inside
 *      any skill markdown outside `LITERAL_TOOL_ALLOWED_SKILLS` (tool-owner
 *      allowlist: acli + xray-cli). Anti-pattern citations exempted. Regex
 *      requires command-shape context to avoid false positives on prose
 *      references like `/acli` or "(acli is T1)". ERROR severity.
 *
 *  15. KIND-MISSING — a T1 / vendored T2 SKILL.md must declare the purpose
 *      axis `metadata.kind` (one of `KNOWN_KINDS`). Committed community
 *      skills (T3 / T4 bodies the project does not author) are exempt, like
 *      every other T1-only check. Doctrine: strategy doc §2b. ERROR severity.
 *
 *  16. KIND-VOCAB — a declared `metadata.kind` must be one of `KNOWN_KINDS`
 *      (context / workflow / utility / core). ERROR severity.
 *
 *  17. KIND-SUFFIX — the slug suffix and the declared kind must agree in BOTH
 *      directions (`KIND_SUFFIX_RULES`): a slug ending `-context` must declare
 *      kind `context` and a `context` skill must end `-context`; a slug ending
 *      `-cli` / `-tool` / `-app` must declare kind `utility` and a `utility`
 *      skill must carry one of those suffixes. Slugs named in
 *      `KIND_SUFFIX_EXEMPT` predate the rule and skip it. `workflow` and
 *      `core` carry no suffix rule. ERROR severity.
 *
 *  18. CAPABILITY-VOCAB — every name in `metadata.requires_capabilities` (the
 *      MCP capabilities a skill needs, declared by CAPABILITY and resolved by
 *      tool-name suffix, never by server prefix) must be in
 *      `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`, the mirror of
 *      agentic-qa-core/references/mcp-capabilities.md §2. Inline `[a, b]` and
 *      block `- a` list forms are both read. ERROR severity.
 *
 *  19. CAPABILITY-UNDECLARED — heuristic half of the correspondence rule
 *      (mcp-capabilities.md §3): a T1 SKILL.md BODY (not its references/, and
 *      outside fenced code blocks) that carries one of the five resolution
 *      tags in `CAPABILITY_TAGS` (`[DB_TOOL]`, `[API_TOOL]`,
 *      `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]`, `[DOCS_TOOL]`, `[WEB_SEARCH_TOOL]`) without
 *      declaring the matching capability. A tag in a legend table trips it,
 *      so the fix is "declare it or drop the row", never a script allowlist.
 *      The reverse (declared but no tag) is NOT checked: skills legitimately
 *      instruct use through tool names or MCP names instead of tags. A skill
 *      of kind `core` is skipped: it hosts the doctrine that describes the
 *      tags and never uses them. WARN severity.
 *
 *  20. FILE-LINE — a `path.ext:N` / `:N-M` / `#LN` citation in the prose of any
 *      committed markdown under .agents/ (community skills and generated
 *      aggregates excluded) or in AGENTS.md, outside fenced blocks and the
 *      frontmatter. A line number shifts on any edit above it; cite the file
 *      plus a symbol or a heading. Per-line escape: `volatile-ok: <reason>`.
 *      Severity: VOLATILE_SEVERITY (Critical Rule #17; canon
 *      agentic-qa-core/references/volatile-facts.md).
 *
 *  21. CURRENT-STATE — a claim about the present in the same prose: "today",
 *      "currently", "as of <year>", a dated "measured / verified", "since
 *      <version>", a measured token or byte size, a tool version after a tool
 *      name, and the Spanish equivalents. Same exclusions and escape hatch.
 *      Severity: VOLATILE_SEVERITY.
 *
 *  22. STAGE-OWNER-DISPATCH — a SKILL.md whose frontmatter declares
 *      `metadata.stage_owner: true` (the stage-owning workflow skills, the set
 *      AGENTS.md §3 used to enumerate by hand) must carry a
 *      `## Subagent Dispatch Strategy` section. ERROR severity.
 *
